	/**
	 * A Boolean value that determines which code page to use to interpret
	 * external text files. When the property is set to `false`,
	 * external text files are interpretted as Unicode.(These files must be
	 * encoded as Unicode when you save them.) When the property is set to
	 * `true`, external text files are interpretted using the
	 * traditional code page of the operating system running the application. The
	 * default value of `useCodePage` is `false`.
	 *
	 * Text that you load as an external file(using
	 * `Loader.load()`, the URLLoader class or URLStream) must have
	 * been saved as Unicode in order for the application to recognize it as
	 * Unicode. To encode external files as Unicode, save the files in an
	 * application that supports Unicode, such as Notepad on Windows.
	 *
	 * If you load external text files that are not Unicode-encoded, set
	 * `useCodePage` to `true`. Add the following as the
	 * first line of code of the file that is loading the data(for Flash
	 * Professional, add it to the first frame):
	 * `System.useCodePage = true;`
	 *
	 * When this code is present, the application interprets external text
	 * using the traditional code page of the operating system. For example, this
	 * is generally CP1252 for an English Windows operating system and Shift-JIS
	 * for a Japanese operating system.
	 *
	 * If you set `useCodePage` to `true`, Flash Player
	 * 6 and later treat text as Flash Player 5 does.(Flash Player 5 treated all
	 * text as if it were in the traditional code page of the operating system
	 * running the player.)
	 *
	 * If you set `useCodePage` to `true`, remember that
	 * the traditional code page of the operating system running the application
	 * must include the characters used in your external text file in order to
	 * display your text. For example, if you load an external text file that
	 * contains Chinese characters, those characters cannot display on a system
	 * that uses the CP1252 code page because that code page does not include
	 * Chinese characters.
	 *
	 * To ensure that users on all platforms can view external text files used
	 * in your application, you should encode all external text files as Unicode
	 * and leave `useCodePage` set to `false`. This way,
	 * the application(Flash Player 6 and later, or AIR) interprets the text as
	 * Unicode.
