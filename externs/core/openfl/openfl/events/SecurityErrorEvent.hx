/**
 * An object dispatches a SecurityErrorEvent object to report the occurrence
 * of a security error. Security errors reported through this class are
 * generally from asynchronous operations, such as loading data, in which
 * security violations may not manifest immediately. Your event listener can
 * access the object's <code>text</code> property to determine what operation
 * was attempted and any URLs that were involved. If there are no event
 * listeners, the debugger version of Flash Player or the AIR Debug Launcher
 * (ADL) application automatically displays an error message that contains the
 * contents of the <code>text</code> property. There is one type of security
 * error event: <code>SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR</code>.
 *
 * <p>Security error events are the final events dispatched for any target
 * object. This means that any other events, including generic error events,
 * are not dispatched for a target object that experiences a security
 * error.</p>
