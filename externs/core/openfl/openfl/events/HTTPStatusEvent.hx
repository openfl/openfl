 * The application dispatches HTTPStatusEvent objects when a network request
 * returns an HTTP status code.
 *
 * <p>HTTPStatusEvent objects are always sent before error or completion
 * events. An HTTPStatusEvent object does not necessarily indicate an error
 * condition; it simply reflects the HTTP status code(if any) that is
 * provided by the networking stack. Some Flash Player environments may be
 * unable to detect HTTP status codes; a status code of 0 is always reported
 * in these cases. </p>
 *
 * <p>In Flash Player, there is only one type of HTTPStatus event:
 * <code>httpStatus</code>. In the AIR runtime, a FileReference, URLLoader, or
 * URLStream can register to listen for an <code>httpResponseStatus</code>,
 * which includes <code>responseURL</code> and <code>responseHeaders</code>
 * properties. These properties are undefined in a <code>httpStatus</code>
 * event.</p>
