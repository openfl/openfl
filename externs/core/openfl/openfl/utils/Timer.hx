/**
 * The Timer class is the interface to timers, which let you run code on a
 * specified time sequence. Use the `start()` method to start a
 * timer. Add an event listener for the `timer` event to set up
 * code to be run on the timer interval.
 *
 * You can create Timer objects to run once or repeat at specified
 * intervals to execute code on a schedule. Depending on the SWF file's
 * framerate or the runtime environment(available memory and other factors),
 * the runtime may dispatch events at slightly offset intervals. For example,
 * if a SWF file is set to play at 10 frames per second(fps), which is 100
 * millisecond intervals, but your timer is set to fire an event at 80
 * milliseconds, the event will be dispatched close to the 100 millisecond
 * interval. Memory-intensive scripts may also offset the events.
 * 
 * @event timer         Dispatched whenever a Timer object reaches an interval
 *                      specified according to the `Timer.delay`
 *                      property.
 * @event timerComplete Dispatched whenever it has completed the number of
 *                      requests set by `Timer.repeatCount`.
