/**
 * The Accelerometer class dispatches events based on activity detected by the
 * device's motion sensor. This data represents the device's location or
 * movement along a 3-dimensional axis. When the device moves, the sensor
 * detects this movement and returns acceleration data. The Accelerometer
 * class provides methods to query whether or not accelerometer is supported,
 * and also to set the rate at which acceleration events are dispatched.
 *
 * **Note:** Use the `Accelerometer.isSupported` property to
 * test the runtime environment for the ability to use this feature. While the
 * Accelerometer class and its members are accessible to the Runtime Versions
 * listed for each API entry, the current environment for the runtime
 * determines the availability of this feature. For example, you can compile
 * code using the Accelerometer class properties for Flash Player 10.1, but
 * you need to use the `Accelerometer.isSupported` property to test
 * for the availability of the Accelerometer feature in the current deployment
 * environment for the Flash Player runtime. If
 * `Accelerometer.isSupported` is `true` at runtime,
 * then Accelerometer support currently exists.
 *
 * _AIR profile support:_ This feature is supported only on mobile
 * devices. It is not supported on desktop or AIR for TV devices. See
 * [AIR Profile Support](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS144092a96ffef7cc16ddeea2126bb46b82f-8000.html)
 * for more information regarding API support across
 * multiple profiles. 
 * 
 * @event status Dispatched when an accelerometer changes its status.
 *
 *               **Note:** On some devices, the accelerometer is always
 *               available. On such devices, an Accelerometer object never
 *               dispatches a `status` event.
 * @event update The `update` event is dispatched in response to
 *               updates from the accelerometer sensor. The event is
 *               dispatched in the following circumstances:
 *
 *               
 *               
 *                * When a new listener function is attached through
 *               `addEventListener()`, this event is delivered once
 *               to all the registered listeners for providing the current
 *               value of the accelerometer.
 *                * Whenever accelerometer updates are obtained from the
 *               platform at device determined intervals.
 *                * Whenever the application misses a change in the
 *               accelerometer(for example, the runtime is resuming after
 *               being idle).
 *               
 *
