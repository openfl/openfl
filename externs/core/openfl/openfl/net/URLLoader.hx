/**
 * The URLLoader class downloads data from a URL as text, binary data, or
 * URL-encoded variables. It is useful for downloading text files, XML, or
 * other information to be used in a dynamic, data-driven application.
 *
 * A URLLoader object downloads all of the data from a URL before making it
 * available to code in the applications. It sends out notifications about the
 * progress of the download, which you can monitor through the
 * `bytesLoaded` and `bytesTotal` properties, as well as
 * through dispatched events.
 *
 * When loading very large video files, such as FLV's, out-of-memory errors
 * may occur. 
 *
 * When you use this class in Flash Player and in AIR application content
 * in security sandboxes other than then application security sandbox,
 * consider the following security model:
 *
 * 
 *  * A SWF file in the local-with-filesystem sandbox may not load data
 * from, or provide data to, a resource that is in the network sandbox. 
 *  *  By default, the calling SWF file and the URL you load must be in
 * exactly the same domain. For example, a SWF file at www.adobe.com can load
 * data only from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a
 * different domain, place a URL policy file on the server hosting the
 * data.
 * 
 *
 * For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer
 * Center Topic: [Security](http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en).
 * 
 * @event complete           Dispatched after all the received data is decoded
 *                           and placed in the data property of the URLLoader
 *                           object. The received data may be accessed once
 *                           this event has been dispatched.
 * @event httpResponseStatus Dispatched if a call to the load() method
 *                           attempts to access data over HTTP, and Adobe AIR
 *                           is able to detect and return the status code for
 *                           the request.
 * @event httpStatus         Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts
 *                           to access data over HTTP. For content running in
 *                           Flash Player, this event is only dispatched if
 *                           the current Flash Player environment is able to
 *                           detect and return the status code for the
 *                           request.(Some browser environments may not be
 *                           able to provide this information.) Note that the
 *                           `httpStatus` event(if any) is sent
 *                           before(and in addition to) any
 *                           `complete` or `error`
 *                           event.
 * @event ioError            Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() results
 *                           in a fatal error that terminates the download.
 * @event open               Dispatched when the download operation commences
 *                           following a call to the
 *                           `URLLoader.load()` method.
 * @event progress           Dispatched when data is received as the download
 *                           operation progresses.
 *
 *                           Note that with a URLLoader object, it is not
 *                           possible to access the data until it has been
 *                           received completely. So, the progress event only
 *                           serves as a notification of how far the download
 *                           has progressed. To access the data before it's
 *                           entirely downloaded, use a URLStream object. 
 * @event securityError      Dispatched if a call to URLLoader.load() attempts
 *                           to load data from a server outside the security
 *                           sandbox. Also dispatched if a call to
 *                           `URLLoader.load()` attempts to load a
 *                           SWZ file and the certificate is invalid or the
 *                           digest string does not match the component.

	 *  * The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated
	 * action, such as a mouse click or key press.
	 *  * If the POST operation is cross-domain(the POST target is not on the

	 * (according to the RFC2046 standards). If the syntax appears to be invalid,
