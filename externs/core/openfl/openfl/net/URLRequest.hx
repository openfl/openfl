/**
 * The URLRequest class captures all of the information in a single HTTP
 * request. URLRequest objects are passed to the `load()` methods
 * of the Loader, URLStream, and URLLoader classes, and to other loading
 * operations, to initiate URL downloads. They are also passed to the
 * `upload()` and `download()` methods of the
 * FileReference class.
 *
 * A SWF file in the local-with-filesystem sandbox may not load data from,
 * or provide data to, a resource that is in the network sandbox. 
 *
 * By default, the calling SWF file and the URL you load must be in the
 * same domain. For example, a SWF file at www.adobe.com can load data only
 * from sources that are also at www.adobe.com. To load data from a different
 * domain, place a URL policy file on the server hosting the data.
 *
 *  However, in Adobe AIR, content in the application security sandbox
 * (content installed with the AIR application) is not restricted by these
 * security limitations. For content running in Adobe AIR, files in the
 * application security sandbox can access URLs using any of the following URL
 * schemes:
 *
 * 
 *  * `http` and `https` 
 *  * `file` 
 *  * `app-storage` 
 *  * `app` 
 * 
 *
 * Content running in Adobe AIR that is not in the application security
 * sandbox observes the same restrictions as content running in the browser
 * (in Flash Player), and loading is governed by the content's domain and any
 * permissions granted in URL policy files.
 *
 * For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer
 * Center Topic: [Security](http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en).

	 * The MIME content type of the content in the the `data`
	 * property.
	 *
	 * The default value is
	 * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
	 *
	 * **Note**:The `FileReference.upload()`,
	 * `FileReference.download()`, and `HTMLLoader.load()`
	 * methods do not support the `URLRequest.contentType`
	 * property.
	 *
	 * When sending a POST request, the values of the `contentType`
	 * and `data` properties must correspond properly. The value of
	 * the `contentType` property instructs servers on how to
	 * interpret the value of the `data` property. 
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * If the value of the `data` property is a URLVariables
	 * object, the value of `contentType` must be
	 * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. 
	 *  *  If the value of the `data` property is any other type,
	 * the value of `contentType` should indicate the type of the POST
	 * data that will be sent(which is the binary or string data contained in
	 * the value of the `data` property). 
	 *  * For `FileReference.upload()`, the Content-Type of the
	 * request is set automatically to `multipart/form-data`, and the
	 * value of the `contentType` property is ignored.
	 * 
	 *
	 *  In Flash Player 10 and later, if you use a multipart Content-Type(for
	 * example "multipart/form-data") that contains an upload(indicated by a
	 * "filename" parameter in a "content-disposition" header within the POST
	 * body), the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
	 * uploads:
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated
	 * action, such as a mouse click or key press.
	 *  * If the POST operation is cross-domain(the POST target is not on the
	 * same server as the SWF file that is sending the POST request), the target
	 * server must provide a URL policy file that permits cross-domain
	 * access.
	 * 
	 *
	 * Also, for any multipart Content-Type, the syntax must be valid
	 * (according to the RFC2046 standards). If the syntax appears to be invalid,
	 * the POST operation is subject to the security rules applied to
	 * uploads.

	/**
	 * An object containing data to be transmitted with the URL request.
	 *
	 * This property is used in conjunction with the `method`
	 * property. When the value of `method` is `GET`, the
	 * value of `data` is appended to the value of
	 * `URLRequest.url`, using HTTP query-string syntax. When the
	 * `method` value is `POST`(or any value other than
	 * `GET`), the value of `data` is transmitted in the
	 * body of the HTTP request.
	 *
	 * The URLRequest API offers binary `POST` support and support
	 * for URL-encoded variables, as well as support for strings. The data object
	 * can be a ByteArray, URLVariables, or String object.
	 *
	 * The way in which the data is used depends on the type of object
	 * used:
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * If the object is a ByteArray object, the binary data of the
	 * ByteArray object is used as `POST` data. For `GET`,
	 * data of ByteArray type is not supported. Also, data of ByteArray type is
	 * not supported for `FileReference.upload()` and
	 * `FileReference.download()`.
	 *  * If the object is a URLVariables object and the method is
	 * `POST`, the variables are encoded using
	 * _x-www-form-urlencoded_ format and the resulting string is used as
	 * `POST` data. An exception is a call to
	 * `FileReference.upload()`, in which the variables are sent as
	 * separate fields in a `multipart/form-data` post.
	 *  * If the object is a URLVariables object and the method is
	 * `GET`, the URLVariables object defines variables to be sent
	 * with the URLRequest object.
	 *  * Otherwise, the object is converted to a string, and the string is
	 * used as the `POST` or `GET` data.
	 * 
	 *
	 * This data is not sent until a method, such as
	 * `navigateToURL()` or `FileReference.upload()`, uses
	 * the URLRequest object.
	 *
	 * **Note**: The value of `contentType` must correspond to
	 * the type of data in the `data` property. See the note in the
	 * description of the `contentType` property.
