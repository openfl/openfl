/**
 * The InteractiveObject class is the abstract base class for all display
 * objects with which the user can interact, using the mouse, keyboard, or
 * other user input device.
 *
 * You cannot instantiate the InteractiveObject class directly. A call to
 * the `new InteractiveObject()` constructor throws an
 * `ArgumentError` exception.
 *
 * The InteractiveObject class itself does not include any APIs for
 * rendering content onscreen. To create a custom subclass of the
 * InteractiveObject class, extend one of the subclasses that do have APIs for
 * rendering content onscreen, such as the Sprite, SimpleButton, TextField, or
 * MovieClip classes.
 * 
 * @event clear                  Dispatched when the user selects 'Clear'(or
 *                               'Delete') from the text context menu. This
 *                               event is dispatched to the object that
 *                               currently has focus. If the object that
 *                               currently has focus is a TextField, the
 *                               default behavior of this event is to cause
 *                               any currently selected text in the text field
 *                               to be deleted.
 * @event click                  Dispatched when a user presses and releases
 *                               the main button of the user's pointing device
 *                               over the same InteractiveObject. For a click
 *                               event to occur, it must always follow this
 *                               series of events in the order of occurrence:
 *                               mouseDown event, then mouseUp. The target
 *                               object must be identical for both of these
 *                               events; otherwise the `click`
 *                               event does not occur. Any number of other
 *                               mouse events can occur at any time between
 *                               the `mouseDown` or
 *                               `mouseUp` events; the
 *                               `click` event still occurs.
 * @event contextMenu            Dispatched when a user gesture triggers the
 *                               context menu associated with this interactive
 *                               object in an AIR application.
 * @event copy                   Dispatched when the user activates the
 *                               platform-specific accelerator key combination
 *                               for a copy operation or selects 'Copy' from
 *                               the text context menu. This event is
 *                               dispatched to the object that currently has
 *                               focus. If the object that currently has focus
 *                               is a TextField, the default behavior of this
 *                               event is to cause any currently selected text
 *                               in the text field to be copied to the
 *                               clipboard.
 * @event cut                    Dispatched when the user activates the
 *                               platform-specific accelerator key combination
 *                               for a cut operation or selects 'Cut' from the
 *                               text context menu. This event is dispatched
 *                               to the object that currently has focus. If
 *                               the object that currently has focus is a
 *                               TextField, the default behavior of this event
 *                               is to cause any currently selected text in
 *                               the text field to be cut to the clipboard.
 * @event doubleClick            Dispatched when a user presses and releases
 *                               the main button of a pointing device twice in
 *                               rapid succession over the same
 *                               InteractiveObject when that object's
 *                               `doubleClickEnabled` flag is set
 *                               to `true`. For a
 *                               `doubleClick` event to occur, it
 *                               must immediately follow the following series
 *                               of events: `mouseDown`,
 *                               `mouseUp`, `click`,
 *                               `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`.
 *                               All of these events must share the same
 *                               target as the `doubleClick` event.
 *                               The second click, represented by the second
 *                               `mouseDown` and
 *                               `mouseUp` events, must occur
 *                               within a specific period of time after the
 *                               `click` event. The allowable
 *                               length of this period varies by operating
 *                               system and can often be configured by the
 *                               user. If the target is a selectable text
 *                               field, the word under the pointer is selected
 *                               as the default behavior. If the target
 *                               InteractiveObject does not have its
 *                               `doubleClickEnabled` flag set to
 *                               `true` it receives two
 *                               `click` events.
 *
 *                               The `doubleClickEnabled`
 *                               property defaults to `false`. 
 *
 *                               The double-click text selection behavior
 *                               of a TextField object is not related to the
 *                               `doubleClick` event. Use
 *                               `TextField.doubleClickEnabled` to
 *                               control TextField selections.
 * @event focusIn                Dispatched _after_ a display object
 *                               gains focus. This situation happens when a
 *                               user highlights the object with a pointing
 *                               device or keyboard navigation. The recipient
 *                               of such focus is called the target object of
 *                               this event, while the corresponding
 *                               InteractiveObject instance that lost focus
 *                               because of this change is called the related
 *                               object. A reference to the related object is
 *                               stored in the receiving object's
 *                               `relatedObject` property. The
 *                               `shiftKey` property is not used.
 *                               This event follows the dispatch of the
 *                               previous object's `focusOut`
 *                               event.
 * @event focusOut               Dispatched _after_ a display object
 *                               loses focus. This happens when a user
 *                               highlights a different object with a pointing
 *                               device or keyboard navigation. The object
 *                               that loses focus is called the target object
 *                               of this event, while the corresponding
 *                               InteractiveObject instance that receives
 *                               focus is called the related object. A
 *                               reference to the related object is stored in
 *                               the target object's
 *                               `relatedObject` property. The
 *                               `shiftKey` property is not used.
 *                               This event precedes the dispatch of the
 *                               `focusIn` event by the related
 *                               object.
 * @event gesturePan             Dispatched when the user moves a point of
 *                               contact over the InteractiveObject instance
 *                               on a touch-enabled device(such as moving a
 *                               finger from left to right over a display
 *                               object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
 *                               touch screen). Some devices might also
 *                               interpret this contact as a
 *                               `mouseOver` event and as a
 *                               `touchOver` event.
 *
 *                               Specifically, if a user moves a finger
 *                               over an InteractiveObject, the
 *                               InteractiveObject instance can dispatch a
 *                               `mouseOver` event or a
 *                               `touchOver` event or a
 *                               `gesturePan` event, or all if the
 *                               current environment supports it. Choose how
 *                               you want to handle the user interaction. Use
 *                               the openfl.ui.Multitouch class to manage touch
 *                               event handling(enable touch gesture event
 *                               handling, simple touch point event handling,
 *                               or disable touch events so only mouse events
 *                               are dispatched). If you choose to handle the
 *                               `mouseOver` event, then the same
 *                               event handler will run on a touch-enabled
 *                               device and a mouse enabled device. However,
 *                               if you choose to handle the
 *                               `gesturePan` event, you can design
 *                               your event handler to respond to the specific
 *                               needs of a touch-enabled environment and
 *                               provide users with a richer touch-enabled
 *                               experience. You can also handle both events,
 *                               separately, to provide a different response
 *                               for a touch event than a mouse event.
 *
 *                               **Note:** See the Multitouch class for
 *                               environment compatibility information.
 * @event gesturePressAndTap     Dispatched when the user creates a point of
 *                               contact with an InteractiveObject instance,
 *                               then taps on a touch-enabled device(such as
 *                               placing several fingers over a display object
 *                               to open a menu and then taps one finger to
 *                               select a menu item on a mobile phone or
 *                               tablet with a touch screen). Some devices
 *                               might also interpret this contact as a
 *                               combination of several mouse events, as well.
 *
 *
 *                               Specifically, if a user moves a finger
 *                               over an InteractiveObject, and then provides
 *                               a secondary tap, the InteractiveObject
 *                               instance can dispatch a
 *                               `mouseOver` event and a
 *                               `click` event(among others) as
 *                               well as the `gesturePressAndTap`
 *                               event, or all if the current environment
 *                               supports it. Choose how you want to handle
 *                               the user interaction. Use the
 *                               openfl.ui.Multitouch class to manage touch

 *                               handling, simple touch point event handling,
 *                               or disable touch events so only mouse events
 *                               are dispatched). If you choose to handle the

 *                               `gesturePressAndTap` event, you
 *                               can design your event handler to respond to
 *                               the specific needs of a touch-enabled
 *                               environment and provide users with a richer
 *                               touch-enabled experience. You can also handle
 *                               both events, separately, to provide a
 *                               different response for a touch event than a
 *                               mouse event.
 *
 *                               When handling the properties of the event
 *                               object, note that the `localX` and
 *                               `localY` properties are set to the
 *                               primary point of contact(the "push"). The
 *                               `offsetX` and `offsetY`
 *                               properties are the distance to the secondary
 *                               point of contact(the "tap").
 * @event gestureRotate          Dispatched when the user performs a rotation
 *                               gesture at a point of contact with an
 *                               InteractiveObject instance(such as touching
 *                               two fingers and rotating them over a display
 *                               object on a mobile phone or tablet with a
 *                               touch screen). Two-finger rotation is a
 *                               common rotation gesture, but each device and
 *                               operating system can have its own
 *                               requirements to indicate rotation. Some
 *                               devices might also interpret this contact as
 *                               a combination of several mouse events, as
 *                               well.
 *

 *                               `keyDown` event and has the
 *                               following characteristics:
 * @event middleClick            Dispatched when a user presses and releases
 *                               the middle button of the user's pointing
 *                               device over the same InteractiveObject. For a
 *                               `middleClick` event to occur, it
 *                               must always follow this series of events in
 *                               the order of occurrence:
 *                               `middleMouseDown` event, then
 *                               `middleMouseUp`. The target object
 *                               must be identical for both of these events;
 *                               otherwise the `middleClick` event
 *                               does not occur. Any number of other mouse
 *                               events can occur at any time between the
 *                               `middleMouseDown` or
 *                               `middleMouseUp` events; the
 *                               `middleClick` event still occurs.
 * @event middleMouseDown        Dispatched when a user presses the middle
 *                               pointing device button over an
 *                               InteractiveObject instance.
 * @event middleMouseUp          Dispatched when a user releases the pointing
 *                               device button over an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance.
 * @event mouseDown              Dispatched when a user presses the pointing
 *                               device button over an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance. If the target is a SimpleButton
 *                               instance, the SimpleButton instance displays
 *                               the `downState` display object as
 *                               the default behavior. If the target is a
 *                               selectable text field, the text field begins
 *                               selection as the default behavior.
 * @event mouseFocusChange       Dispatched when the user attempts to change
 *                               focus by using a pointer device. The default
 *                               behavior of this event is to change the focus
 *                               and dispatch the corresponding
 *                               `focusIn` and
 *                               `focusOut` events.
 *
 *                               This event is dispatched to the object
 *                               that currently has focus. The related object
 *                               for this event is the InteractiveObject
 *                               instance that receives focus if you do not
 *                               prevent the default behavior. You can prevent
 *                               the change in focus by calling
 *                               `preventDefault()` in an event
 *                               listener that is properly registered with the
 *                               target object. The `shiftKey`
 *                               property is not used. Focus changes and
 *                               `focusIn` and
 *                               `focusOut` events are dispatched
 *                               by default.
 * @event mouseMove              Dispatched when a user moves the pointing
 *                               device while it is over an InteractiveObject.
 *                               If the target is a text field that the user
 *                               is selecting, the selection is updated as the
 *                               default behavior.
 * @event mouseOut               Dispatched when the user moves a pointing
 *                               device away from an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance. The event target is the object
 *                               previously under the pointing device. The
 *                               `relatedObject` is the object the
 *                               pointing device has moved to. If the target
 *                               is a SimpleButton instance, the button
 *                               displays the `upState` display
 *                               object as the default behavior.
 *
 *                               The `mouseOut` event is
 *                               dispatched each time the mouse leaves the
 *                               area of any child object of the display
 *                               object container, even if the mouse remains
 *                               over another child object of the display
 *                               object container. This is different behavior
 *                               than the purpose of the `rollOut`
 *                               event, which is to simplify the coding of
 *                               rollover behaviors for display object
 *                               containers with children. When the mouse
 *                               leaves the area of a display object or the
 *                               area of any of its children to go to an
 *                               object that is not one of its children, the
 *                               display object dispatches the
 *                               `rollOut` event.The
 *                               `rollOut` events are dispatched
 *                               consecutively up the parent chain of the
 *                               object, starting with the object and ending
 *                               with the highest parent that is neither the
 *                               root nor an ancestor of the
 *                               `relatedObject`.
 * @event mouseOver              Dispatched when the user moves a pointing
 *                               device over an InteractiveObject instance.
 *                               The `relatedObject` is the object
 *                               that was previously under the pointing
 *                               device. If the target is a SimpleButton
 *                               instance, the object displays the
 *                               `overState` or
 *                               `upState` display object,
 *                               depending on whether the mouse button is
 *                               down, as the default behavior.
 *
 *                               The `mouseOver` event is
 *                               dispatched each time the mouse enters the
 *                               area of any child object of the display
 *                               object container, even if the mouse was
 *                               already over another child object of the
 *                               display object container. This is different
 *                               behavior than the purpose of the
 *                               `rollOver` event, which is to
 *                               simplify the coding of rollout behaviors for
 *                               display object containers with children. When
 *                               the mouse enters the area of a display object
 *                               or the area of any of its children from an
 *                               object that is not one of its children, the
 *                               display object dispatches the
 *                               `rollOver` event. The
 *                               `rollOver` events are dispatched
 *                               consecutively down the parent chain of the
 *                               object, starting with the highest parent that
 *                               is neither the root nor an ancestor of the
 *                               `relatedObject` and ending with
 *                               the object.
 * @event mouseUp                Dispatched when a user releases the pointing
 *                               device button over an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance. If the target is a SimpleButton
 *                               instance, the object displays the
 *                               `upState` display object. If the
 *                               target is a selectable text field, the text
 *                               field ends selection as the default behavior.
 * @event mouseWheel             Dispatched when a mouse wheel is spun over an
 *                               InteractiveObject instance. If the target is
 *                               a text field, the text scrolls as the default
 *                               behavior. Only available on Microsoft Windows
 *                               operating systems.
 * @event nativeDragComplete     Dispatched by the drag initiator
 *                               InteractiveObject when the user releases the
 *                               drag gesture.
 *
 *                               The event's dropAction property indicates
 *                               the action set by the drag target object; a
 *                               value of "none"
 *                              (`DragActions.NONE`) indicates
 *                               that the drop was canceled or was not
 *                               accepted.
 *
 *                               The `nativeDragComplete` event
 *                               handler is a convenient place to update the
 *                               state of the initiating display object, for
 *                               example, by removing an item from a list(on
 *                               a drag action of "move"), or by changing the
 *                               visual properties.
 * @event nativeDragDrop         Dispatched by the target InteractiveObject
 *                               when a dragged object is dropped on it and
 *                               the drop has been accepted with a call to
 *                               DragManager.acceptDragDrop().
 *
 *                               Access the dropped data using the event
 *                               object `clipboard` property.
 *
 *                               The handler for this event should set the
 *                               `DragManager.dropAction` property
 *                               to provide feedback to the initiator object
 *                               about which drag action was taken. If no
 *                               value is set, the DragManager will select a
 *                               default value from the list of allowed
 *                               actions.
 * @event nativeDragEnter        Dispatched by an InteractiveObject when a
 *                               drag gesture enters its boundary.
 *
 *                               Handle either the
 *                               `nativeDragEnter` or
 *                               `nativeDragOver` events to allow
 *                               the display object to become the drop
 *                               target.
 *
 *                               To determine whether the dispatching
 *                               display object can accept the drop, check the
 *                               suitability of the data in
 *                               `clipboard` property of the event
 *                               object, and the allowed drag actions in the
 *                               `allowedActions` property.
 * @event nativeDragExit         Dispatched by an InteractiveObject when a
 *                               drag gesture leaves its boundary.
 * @event nativeDragOver         Dispatched by an InteractiveObject
 *                               continually while a drag gesture remains
 *                               within its boundary.
 *
 *                               `nativeDragOver` events are
 *                               dispatched whenever the mouse is moved. On
 *                               Windows and Mac, they are also dispatched on
 *                               a short timer interval even when the mouse
 *                               has not moved.
 *
 *                               Handle either the
 *                               `nativeDragOver` or
 *                               `nativeDragEnter` events to allow
 *                               the display object to become the drop
 *                               target.
 *
 *                               To determine whether the dispatching
 *                               display object can accept the drop, check the
 *                               suitability of the data in
 *                               `clipboard` property of the event
 *                               object, and the allowed drag actions in the
 *                               `allowedActions` property.
 * @event nativeDragStart        Dispatched at the beginning of a drag
 *                               operation by the InteractiveObject that is
 *                               specified as the drag initiator in the
 *                               DragManager.doDrag() call.
 * @event nativeDragUpdate       Dispatched during a drag operation by the
 *                               InteractiveObject that is specified as the
 *                               drag initiator in the DragManager.doDrag()
 *                               call.
 *
 *                               `nativeDragUpdate` events are
 *                               not dispatched on Linux.
 * @event paste                  Dispatched when the user activates the
 *                               platform-specific accelerator key combination
 *                               for a paste operation or selects 'Paste' from
 *                               the text context menu. This event is
 *                               dispatched to the object that currently has
 *                               focus. If the object that currently has focus
 *                               is a TextField, the default behavior of this
 *                               event is to cause the contents of the
 *                               clipboard to be pasted into the text field at
 *                               the current insertion point replacing any
 *                               currently selected text in the text field.
 * @event rightClick             Dispatched when a user presses and releases
 *                               the right button of the user's pointing
 *                               device over the same InteractiveObject. For a
 *                               `rightClick` event to occur, it
 *                               must always follow this series of events in
 *                               the order of occurrence:
 *                               `rightMouseDown` event, then
 *                               `rightMouseUp`. The target object
 *                               must be identical for both of these events;
 *                               otherwise the `rightClick` event
 *                               does not occur. Any number of other mouse
 *                               events can occur at any time between the
 *                               `rightMouseDown` or
 *                               `rightMouseUp` events; the
 *                               `rightClick` event still occurs.
 * @event rightMouseDown         Dispatched when a user presses the pointing
 *                               device button over an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance.
 * @event rightMouseUp           Dispatched when a user releases the pointing
 *                               device button over an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance.
 * @event rollOut                Dispatched when the user moves a pointing
 *                               device away from an InteractiveObject
 *                               instance. The event target is the object
 *                               previously under the pointing device or a
 *                               parent of that object. The
 *                               `relatedObject` is the object that
 *                               the pointing device has moved to. The
 *                               `rollOut` events are dispatched
 *                               consecutively up the parent chain of the
 *                               object, starting with the object and ending
 *                               with the highest parent that is neither the
 *                               root nor an ancestor of the
 *                               `relatedObject`.
 *
 *                               The purpose of the `rollOut`
 *                               event is to simplify the coding of rollover
 *                               behaviors for display object containers with
 *                               children. When the mouse leaves the area of a
 *                               display object or the area of any of its
 *                               children to go to an object that is not one
 *                               of its children, the display object
 *                               dispatches the `rollOut` event.
 *                               This is different behavior than that of the
 *                               `mouseOut` event, which is
 *                               dispatched each time the mouse leaves the
 *                               area of any child object of the display
 *                               object container, even if the mouse remains
 *                               over another child object of the display
 *                               object container.
 * @event rollOver               Dispatched when the user moves a pointing
 *                               device over an InteractiveObject instance.
 *                               The event target is the object under the
 *                               pointing device or a parent of that object.
 *                               The `relatedObject` is the object
 *                               that was previously under the pointing
 *                               device. The `rollOver` events are
 *                               dispatched consecutively down the parent
 *                               chain of the object, starting with the
 *                               highest parent that is neither the root nor
 *                               an ancestor of the `relatedObject`
 *                               and ending with the object.
 *
 *                               The purpose of the `rollOver`
 *                               event is to simplify the coding of rollout
 *                               behaviors for display object containers with
 *                               children. When the mouse enters the area of a
 *                               display object or the area of any of its
 *                               children from an object that is not one of
 *                               its children, the display object dispatches
 *                               the `rollOver` event. This is
 *                               different behavior than that of the
 *                               `mouseOver` event, which is
 *                               dispatched each time the mouse enters the
 *                               area of any child object of the display
 *                               object container, even if the mouse was
 *                               already over another child object of the
 *                               display object container. 
 * @event selectAll              Dispatched when the user activates the
 *                               platform-specific accelerator key combination
 *                               for a select all operation or selects 'Select
 *                               All' from the text context menu. This event
 *                               is dispatched to the object that currently
 *                               has focus. If the object that currently has
 *                               focus is a TextField, the default behavior of
 *                               this event is to cause all the contents of
 *                               the text field to be selected.
 * @event softKeyboardActivate   Dispatched immediately after the soft
 *                               keyboard is raised.
 * @event softKeyboardActivating Dispatched immediately before the soft
 *                               keyboard is raised.
 * @event softKeyboardDeactivate Dispatched immediately after the soft
 *                               keyboard is lowered.
 * @event tabChildrenChange      Dispatched when the value of the object's
 *                               `tabChildren` flag changes.
 * @event tabEnabledChange       Dispatched when the object's
 *                               `tabEnabled` flag changes.
 * @event tabIndexChange         Dispatched when the value of the object's
 *                               `tabIndex` property changes.
 * @event textInput              Dispatched when a user enters one or more
 *                               characters of text. Various text input
 *                               methods can generate this event, including
 *                               standard keyboards, input method editors
 *                              (IMEs), voice or speech recognition systems,
 *                               and even the act of pasting plain text with
 *                               no formatting or style information.
 * @event touchBegin             Dispatched when the user first contacts a
 *                               touch-enabled device(such as touches a
 *                               finger to a mobile phone or tablet with a
 *                               touch screen). Some devices might also
 *                               interpret this contact as a
 *                               `mouseDown` event.
 *
 *                               Specifically, if a user touches a finger
 *                               to a touch screen, the InteractiveObject
 *                               instance can dispatch a
 *                               `mouseDown` event or a
 *                               `touchBegin` event, or both if the
 *                               current environment supports it. Choose how
 *                               you want to handle the user interaction. Use

 *                               handling, simple touch point event handling,
 *                               or disable touch events so only mouse events
 *                               are dispatched). If you choose to handle the
 *                               `mouseDown` event, then the same
 *                               event handler will run on a touch-enabled
 *                               device and a mouse enabled device. However,
 *                               if you choose to handle the
 *                               `touchBegin` event, you can design

 *                               experience. You can also handle both events,
 *                               separately, to provide a different response
 *                               for a touch event than a mouse event.

 * @event touchEnd               Dispatched when the user removes contact with
 *                               a touch-enabled device(such as lifts a
 *                               finger off a mobile phone or tablet with a

 *                               so only mouse events are dispatched). If you

 *                               device. However, if you choose to handle the
 *                               `touchOut` event, you can design
