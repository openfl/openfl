/**
 * The MovieClip class inherits from the following classes: Sprite,
 * DisplayObjectContainer, InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and
 * EventDispatcher.
 *
 * Unlike the Sprite object, a MovieClip object has a timeline.
 *
 * >In Flash Professional, the methods for the MovieClip class provide the
 * same functionality as actions that target movie clips. Some additional
 * methods do not have equivalent actions in the Actions toolbox in the
 * Actions panel in the Flash authoring tool. 
 *
 * Children instances placed on the Stage in Flash Professional cannot be
 * accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent instance since
 * they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before
 * accessing the child, the parent must instead either create the child
 * instance by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for
 * the child to dispatch its `Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE` event.
 *
 * If you modify any of the following properties of a MovieClip object that
 * contains a motion tween, the playhead is stopped in that MovieClip object:
 * `alpha`, `blendMode`, `filters`,
 * `height`, `opaqueBackground`, `rotation`,
 * `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `scale9Grid`,
 * `scrollRect`, `transform`, `visible`,
 * `width`, `x`, or `y`. However, it does not
 * stop the playhead in any child MovieClip objects of that MovieClip
 * object.
 *
 * **Note:**Flash Lite 4 supports the MovieClip.opaqueBackground
 * property only if FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE is defined. The default configuration
 * of Flash Lite 4 does not define FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE. To enable the
 * MovieClip.opaqueBackground property for a suitable device, define
 * FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE in your project.
