/**
 * The Stage class represents the main drawing area.
 *
 * For SWF content running in the browser(in Flash<sup>Â®</sup> Player),
 * the Stage represents the entire area where Flash content is shown. For
 * content running in AIR on desktop operating systems, each NativeWindow
 * object has a corresponding Stage object.
 *
 * The Stage object is not globally accessible. You need to access it
 * through the `stage` property of a DisplayObject instance.
 *
 * The Stage class has several ancestor classes  -  DisplayObjectContainer,
 * InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and EventDispatcher  -  from which it
 * inherits properties and methods. Many of these properties and methods are
 * either inapplicable to Stage objects, or require security checks when
 * called on a Stage object. The properties and methods that require security
 * checks are documented as part of the Stage class.
 *
 * In addition, the following inherited properties are inapplicable to
 * Stage objects. If you try to set them, an IllegalOperationError is thrown.
 * These properties may always be read, but since they cannot be set, they
 * will always contain default values.
 *
 * 
 *  * `accessibilityProperties`
 *  * `alpha`
 *  * `blendMode`
 *  * `cacheAsBitmap`
 *  * `contextMenu`
 *  * `filters`
 *  * `focusRect`
 *  * `loaderInfo`
 *  * `mask`
 *  * `mouseEnabled`
 *  * `name`
 *  * `opaqueBackground`
 *  * `rotation`
 *  * `scale9Grid`
 *  * `scaleX`
 *  * `scaleY`
 *  * `scrollRect`
 *  * `tabEnabled`
 *  * `tabIndex`
 *  * `transform`
 *  * `visible`
 *  * `x`
 *  * `y`
 * 
 *
 * Some events that you might expect to be a part of the Stage class, such
 * as `enterFrame`, `exitFrame`,
 * `frameConstructed`, and `render`, cannot be Stage
 * events because a reference to the Stage object cannot be guaranteed to
 * exist in every situation where these events are used. Because these events
 * cannot be dispatched by the Stage object, they are instead dispatched by
 * every DisplayObject instance, which means that you can add an event
 * listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for these events. These
 * events, which are part of the DisplayObject class, are called broadcast
 * events to differentiate them from events that target a specific
 * DisplayObject instance. Two other broadcast events, `activate`
 * and `deactivate`, belong to DisplayObject's superclass,
 * EventDispatcher. The `activate` and `deactivate`
 * events behave similarly to the DisplayObject broadcast events, except that
 * these two events are dispatched not only by all DisplayObject instances,
 * but also by all EventDispatcher instances and instances of other
 * EventDispatcher subclasses. For more information on broadcast events, see
 * the DisplayObject class.
 * 
 * @event fullScreen             Dispatched when the Stage object enters, or
 *                               leaves, full-screen mode. A change in
 *                               full-screen mode can be initiated through
 *                               ActionScript, or the user invoking a keyboard
 *                               shortcut, or if the current focus leaves the
 *                               full-screen window.
 * @event mouseLeave             Dispatched by the Stage object when the
 *                               pointer moves out of the stage area. If the
 *                               mouse button is pressed, the event is not
 *                               dispatched.
 * @event orientationChange      Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
 *                               orientation changes.
 *
 *                               Orientation changes can occur when the
 *                               user rotates the device, opens a slide-out
 *                               keyboard, or when the
 *                               `setAspectRatio()` is called.
 *
 *                               **Note:** If the
 *                               `autoOrients` property is
 *                               `false`, then the stage
 *                               orientation does not change when a device is
 *                               rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
 *                               only dispatched for device rotation when
 *                               `autoOrients` is
 *                               `true`.
 * @event orientationChanging    Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
 *                               orientation begins changing.
 *
 *                               **Important:** orientationChanging
 *                               events are not dispatched on Android
 *                               devices.
 *
 *                               **Note:** If the
 *                               `autoOrients` property is
 *                               `false`, then the stage
 *                               orientation does not change when a device is
 *                               rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
 *                               only dispatched for device rotation when
 *                               `autoOrients` is
 *                               `true`.
 * @event resize                 Dispatched when the `scaleMode`
 *                               property of the Stage object is set to
 *                               `StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE` and the
 *                               SWF file is resized.
 * @event stageVideoAvailability Dispatched by the Stage object when the state
 *                               of the stageVideos property changes.

	 * `Stage.scaleMode` property or the SWF file's `embed`
	 * tag settings in the HTML file). If the `scaleMode` property is
	 * set to `noScale` while the application transitions to

	 *
	 * The following restrictions apply to SWF files that play within an HTML
	 * page(not those using the stand-alone Flash Player or not running in the
	 * AIR runtime):
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * To enable full-screen mode, add the `allowFullScreen`
	 * parameter to the `object` and `embed` tags in the
	 * HTML page that includes the SWF file, with `allowFullScreen`
	 * set to `"true"`, as shown in the following example: 
	 *  * Full-screen mode is initiated in response to a mouse click or key
	 * press by the user; the movie cannot change `Stage.displayState`
	 * without user input. Flash runtimes restrict keyboard input in full-screen
	 * mode. Acceptable keys include keyboard shortcuts that terminate
	 * full-screen mode and non-printing keys such as arrows, space, Shift, and
	 * Tab keys. Keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode are: Escape
	 * (Windows, Linux, and Mac), Control+W(Windows), Command+W(Mac), and
	 * Alt+F4.
	 *
	 * A Flash runtime dialog box appears over the movie when users enter
	 * full-screen mode to inform the users they are in full-screen mode and that
	 * they can press the Escape key to end full-screen mode.
	 * 
	 *  * Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, full-screen works the same in
	 * windowless mode as it does in window mode. If you set the Window Mode
	 * (`wmode` in the HTML) to Opaque Windowless
	 * (`opaque`) or Transparent Windowless
	 * (`transparent`), full-screen can be initiated, but the
	 * full-screen window will always be opaque.
	 * 
	 *
