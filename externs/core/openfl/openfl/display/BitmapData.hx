/**
 * The BitmapData class lets you work with the data(pixels) of a Bitmap
 * object. You can use the methods of the BitmapData class to create
 * arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap images and manipulate them
 * in various ways at runtime. You can also access the BitmapData for a bitmap
 * image that you load with the `openfl.Assets` or 
 * `openfl.display.Loader` classes.
 *
 * This class lets you separate bitmap rendering operations from the
 * internal display updating routines of OpenFL. By manipulating a
 * BitmapData object directly, you can create complex images without incurring
 * the per-frame overhead of constantly redrawing the content from vector
 * data.
 *
 * The methods of the BitmapData class support effects that are not
 * available through the filters available to non-bitmap display objects.
 *
 * A BitmapData object contains an array of pixel data. This data can
 * represent either a fully opaque bitmap or a transparent bitmap that
 * contains alpha channel data. Either type of BitmapData object is stored as
 * a buffer of 32-bit integers. Each 32-bit integer determines the properties
 * of a single pixel in the bitmap.
 *
 * Each 32-bit integer is a combination of four 8-bit channel values(from
 * 0 to 255) that describe the alpha transparency and the red, green, and blue
 * (ARGB) values of the pixel.(For ARGB values, the most significant byte
 * represents the alpha channel value, followed by red, green, and blue.)
 *
 * The four channels(alpha, red, green, and blue) are represented as
 * numbers when you use them with the `BitmapData.copyChannel()`
 * method or the `DisplacementMapFilter.componentX` and
 * `DisplacementMapFilter.componentY` properties, and these numbers
 * are represented by the following constants in the BitmapDataChannel
 * class:
 *
 * 
 *  * `BitmapDataChannel.ALPHA`
 *  * `BitmapDataChannel.RED`
 *  * `BitmapDataChannel.GREEN`
 *  * `BitmapDataChannel.BLUE`
 * 
 *
 * You can attach BitmapData objects to a Bitmap object by using the
 * `bitmapData` property of the Bitmap object.
 *
 * You can use a BitmapData object to fill a Graphics object by using the
 * `Graphics.beginBitmapFill()` method.
 * 
 * You can also use a BitmapData object to perform batch tile rendering
 * using the `openfl.display.Tilemap` class.
 *
 * In Flash Player 10, the maximum size for a BitmapData object
 * is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total number of pixels cannot
 * exceed 16,777,215 pixels.(So, if a BitmapData object is 8,191 pixels wide,
 * it can only be 2,048 pixels high.) In Flash Player 9 and earlier, the limitation 
 * is 2,880 pixels in height and 2,880 in width.

	 * each octave function is twice the frequency of the one before it. Perlin
	 * noise has been described as a "fractal sum of noise" because it combines
	 * multiple sets of noise data with different levels of detail.
	 *
	 * You can use Perlin noise functions to simulate natural phenomena and

	 * cases, the output of a Perlin noise function is not displayed directly but
	 * is used to enhance other images and give them pseudo-random
	 * variations.
	 *
	 * Simple digital random noise functions often produce images with harsh,
	 * contrasting points. This kind of harsh contrast is not often found in
