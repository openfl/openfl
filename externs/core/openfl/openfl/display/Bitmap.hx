/**
 * The Bitmap class represents display objects that represent bitmap images.
 * These can be images that you load with the `openfl.Assets` or 
 * `openfl.display.Loader` classes, or they can be images that you 
 * create with the `Bitmap()` constructor.
 *
 * The `Bitmap()` constructor allows you to create a Bitmap
 * object that contains a reference to a BitmapData object. After you create a
 * Bitmap object, use the `addChild()` or `addChildAt()`
 * method of the parent DisplayObjectContainer instance to place the bitmap on
 * the display list.
 *
 * A Bitmap object can share its BitmapData reference among several Bitmap
 * objects, independent of translation or rotation properties. Because you can
 * create multiple Bitmap objects that reference the same BitmapData object,
 * multiple display objects can use the same complex BitmapData object without
 * incurring the memory overhead of a BitmapData object for each display
 * object instance.
 *
 * A BitmapData object can be drawn to the screen by a Bitmap object in one
 * of two ways: by using the default hardware renderer with a single hardware surface, 
 * or by using the slower software renderer when 3D acceleration is not available.
 * 
 * If you would prefer to perform a batch rendering command, rather than using a
 * single surface for each Bitmap object, you can also draw to the screen using the
 * `openfl.display.Tilemap` class.
 *
 * **Note:** The Bitmap class is not a subclass of the InteractiveObject
 * class, so it cannot dispatch mouse events. However, you can use the
 * `addEventListener()` method of the display object container that
 * contains the Bitmap object.
