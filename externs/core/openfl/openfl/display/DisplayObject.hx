/**
 * The DisplayObject class is the base class for all objects that can be
 * placed on the display list. The display list manages all objects displayed
 * in openfl. Use the DisplayObjectContainer class to arrange the
 * display objects in the display list. DisplayObjectContainer objects can
 * have child display objects, while other display objects, such as Shape and
 * TextField objects, are "leaf" nodes that have only parents and siblings, no
 * children.
 *
 * The DisplayObject class supports basic functionality like the _x_
 * and _y_ position of an object, as well as more advanced properties of
 * the object such as its transformation matrix. 
 *
 * DisplayObject is an abstract base class; therefore, you cannot call
 * DisplayObject directly. Invoking `new DisplayObject()` throws an
 * `ArgumentError` exception. 
 *
 * All display objects inherit from the DisplayObject class.
 *
 * The DisplayObject class itself does not include any APIs for rendering
 * content onscreen. For that reason, if you want create a custom subclass of
 * the DisplayObject class, you will want to extend one of its subclasses that
 * do have APIs for rendering content onscreen, such as the Shape, Sprite,
 * Bitmap, SimpleButton, TextField, or MovieClip class.
 *
 * The DisplayObject class contains several broadcast events. Normally, the
 * target of any particular event is a specific DisplayObject instance. For
 * example, the target of an `added` event is the specific
 * DisplayObject instance that was added to the display list. Having a single
 * target restricts the placement of event listeners to that target and in
 * some cases the target's ancestors on the display list. With broadcast
 * events, however, the target is not a specific DisplayObject instance, but
 * rather all DisplayObject instances, including those that are not on the
 * display list. This means that you can add a listener to any DisplayObject
 * instance to listen for broadcast events. In addition to the broadcast
 * events listed in the DisplayObject class's Events table, the DisplayObject
 * class also inherits two broadcast events from the EventDispatcher class:
 * `activate` and `deactivate`.
 *
 * Some properties previously used in the ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0
 * MovieClip, TextField, and Button classes(such as `_alpha`,
 * `_height`, `_name`, `_width`,
 * `_x`, `_y`, and others) have equivalents in the
 * ActionScript 3.0 DisplayObject class that are renamed so that they no
 * longer begin with the underscore(_) character.
 *
 * For more information, see the "Display Programming" chapter of the
 * _ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide_.
 * 
 * @event added            Dispatched when a display object is added to the
 *                         display list. The following methods trigger this
 *                         event:
 *                         `DisplayObjectContainer.addChild()`,
 *                         `DisplayObjectContainer.addChildAt()`.
 * @event addedToStage     Dispatched when a display object is added to the on
 *                         stage display list, either directly or through the
 *                         addition of a sub tree in which the display object
 *                         is contained. The following methods trigger this
 *                         event:
 *                         `DisplayObjectContainer.addChild()`,
 *                         `DisplayObjectContainer.addChildAt()`.
 * @event enterFrame       [broadcast event] Dispatched when the playhead is
 *                         entering a new frame. If the playhead is not
 *                         moving, or if there is only one frame, this event
 *                         is dispatched continuously in conjunction with the
 *                         frame rate. This event is a broadcast event, which
 *                         means that it is dispatched by all display objects
 *                         with a listener registered for this event.
 * @event exitFrame        [broadcast event] Dispatched when the playhead is
 *                         exiting the current frame. All frame scripts have
 *                         been run. If the playhead is not moving, or if
 *                         there is only one frame, this event is dispatched
 *                         continuously in conjunction with the frame rate.
 *                         This event is a broadcast event, which means that
 *                         it is dispatched by all display objects with a
 *                         listener registered for this event.
 * @event frameConstructed [broadcast event] Dispatched after the constructors
 *                         of frame display objects have run but before frame
 *                         scripts have run. If the playhead is not moving, or
 *                         if there is only one frame, this event is
 *                         dispatched continuously in conjunction with the
 *                         frame rate. This event is a broadcast event, which
 *                         means that it is dispatched by all display objects

 * @event removed          Dispatched when a display object is about to be
 *                         removed from the display list. Two methods of the
 *                         DisplayObjectContainer class generate this event:
 *                         `removeChild()` and
 *                         `removeChildAt()`.
 *
 *                         The following methods of a
 *                         DisplayObjectContainer object also generate this
 *                         event if an object must be removed to make room for
 *                         the new object: `addChild()`,
 *                         `addChildAt()`, and
 *                         `setChildIndex()`. 
 * @event removedFromStage Dispatched when a display object is about to be
 *                         removed from the display list, either directly or
 *                         through the removal of a sub tree in which the
 *                         display object is contained. Two methods of the
 *                         DisplayObjectContainer class generate this event:
 *                         `removeChild()` and

 *                         `addChildAt()`, and
 *                         `setChildIndex()`. 
 * @event render           [broadcast event] Dispatched when the display list
 *                         is about to be updated and rendered. This event
 *                         provides the last opportunity for objects listening
 *                         for this event to make changes before the display
 *                         list is rendered. You must call the
 *                         `invalidate()` method of the Stage
 *                         object each time you want a `render`
 *                         event to be dispatched. `Render` events
 *                         are dispatched to an object only if there is mutual
 *                         trust between it and the object that called
 *                         `Stage.invalidate()`. This event is a
 *                         broadcast event, which means that it is dispatched
 *                         by all display objects with a listener registered
 *                         for this event.
 *
 *                         **Note: **This event is not dispatched if the
 *                         display is not rendering. This is the case when the
 *                         content is either minimized or obscured.

	 * All vector data for a display object that has a cached bitmap is drawn

	 *

	 *
	 * After you set the `cacheAsBitmap` property to

	 * significantly faster depending on the complexity of the vector content.
	 * 
	 *
	 * The `cacheAsBitmap` property is automatically set to
	 * `true` whenever you apply a filter to a display object(when

	 * instead renders from vector data in the following cases:
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * The bitmap is too large. In AIR 1.5 and Flash Player 10, the maximum
	 * size for a bitmap image is 8,191 pixels in width or height, and the total

	/**
	 * An indexed array that contains each filter object currently associated
	 * with the display object. The openfl.filters package contains several
	 * classes that define specific filters you can use.
	 *
	 * Filters can be applied in Flash Professional at design time, or at run
	 * time by using ActionScript code. To apply a filter by using ActionScript,
	 * you must make a temporary copy of the entire `filters` array,
	 * modify the temporary array, then assign the value of the temporary array
	 * back to the `filters` array. You cannot directly add a new
	 * filter object to the `filters` array.
	 *
	 * To add a filter by using ActionScript, perform the following steps
	 * (assume that the target display object is named
	 * `myDisplayObject`):
	 *
	 *  1. Create a new filter object by using the constructor method of your
	 * chosen filter class.
	 *  2. Assign the value of the `myDisplayObject.filters` array
	 * to a temporary array, such as one named `myFilters`.
	 *  3. Add the new filter object to the `myFilters` temporary
	 * array.
	 *  4. Assign the value of the temporary array to the
	 * `myDisplayObject.filters` array.
	 *
	 * If the `filters` array is undefined, you do not need to use
	 * a temporary array. Instead, you can directly assign an array literal that
	 * contains one or more filter objects that you create. The first example in
	 * the Examples section adds a drop shadow filter by using code that handles
	 * both defined and undefined `filters` arrays.
	 *
	 * To modify an existing filter object, you must use the technique of
	 * modifying a copy of the `filters` array:
	 *
	 *  1. Assign the value of the `filters` array to a temporary
	 * array, such as one named `myFilters`.
	 *  2. Modify the property by using the temporary array,
	 * `myFilters`. For example, to set the quality property of the
	 * first filter in the array, you could use the following code:
	 * `myFilters[0].quality = 1;`
	 *  3. Assign the value of the temporary array to the `filters`
	 * array.
	 *
	 * At load time, if a display object has an associated filter, it is
	 * marked to cache itself as a transparent bitmap. From this point forward,
	 * as long as the display object has a valid filter list, the player caches
	 * the display object as a bitmap. This source bitmap is used as a source
	 * image for the filter effects. Each display object usually has two bitmaps:
	 * one with the original unfiltered source display object and another for the
	 * final image after filtering. The final image is used when rendering. As
	 * long as the display object does not change, the final image does not need
	 * updating.
	 *
	 * The openfl.filters package includes classes for filters. For example, to
	 * create a DropShadow filter, you would write:
	 * 
	 * @throws ArgumentError When `filters` includes a ShaderFilter
	 *                       and the shader output type is not compatible with

	 * The current scaling grid that is in effect. If set to `null`,
	 * the entire display object is scaled normally when any scale transformation
	 * is applied.
	 *
	 * When you define the `scale9Grid` property, the display
	 * object is divided into a grid with nine regions based on the
	 * `scale9Grid` rectangle, which defines the center region of the
	 * grid. The eight other regions of the grid are the following areas: 
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * The upper-left corner outside of the rectangle
	 *  * The area above the rectangle 
	 *  * The upper-right corner outside of the rectangle
	 *  * The area to the left of the rectangle
	 *  * The area to the right of the rectangle
	 *  * The lower-left corner outside of the rectangle
	 *  * The area below the rectangle
	 *  * The lower-right corner outside of the rectangle
	 * 
	 *
	 * You can think of the eight regions outside of the center(defined by
	 * the rectangle) as being like a picture frame that has special rules
	 * applied to it when scaled.
	 *
	 * When the `scale9Grid` property is set and a display object
	 * is scaled, all text and gradients are scaled normally; however, for other
	 * types of objects the following rules apply:
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * Content in the center region is scaled normally. 
	 *  * Content in the corners is not scaled. 
	 *  * Content in the top and bottom regions is scaled horizontally only.
	 * Content in the left and right regions is scaled vertically only.
	 *  * All fills(including bitmaps, video, and gradients) are stretched to
	 * fit their shapes.
	 * 
	 *
	 * If a display object is rotated, all subsequent scaling is normal(and
	 * the `scale9Grid` property is ignored).
	 *
	 * For example, consider the following display object and a rectangle that
	 * is applied as the display object's `scale9Grid`:
	 *
	 * A common use for setting `scale9Grid` is to set up a display
	 * object to be used as a component, in which edge regions retain the same
	 * width when the component is scaled.
