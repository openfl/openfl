/**
 * The Sprite class is a basic display list building block: a display list
 * node that can display graphics and can also contain children.
 *
 * A Sprite object is similar to a movie clip, but does not have a
 * timeline. Sprite is an appropriate base class for objects that do not
 * require timelines. For example, Sprite would be a logical base class for
 * user interface(UI) components that typically do not use the timeline.
 *
 * The Sprite class is new in ActionScript 3.0. It provides an alternative
 * to the functionality of the MovieClip class, which retains all the
 * functionality of previous ActionScript releases to provide backward
 * compatibility.

	/**
	 * Specifies the button mode of this sprite. If `true`, this
	 * sprite behaves as a button, which means that it triggers the display of
	 * the hand cursor when the pointer passes over the sprite and can receive a
	 * `click` event if the enter or space keys are pressed when the
	 * sprite has focus. You can suppress the display of the hand cursor by
	 * setting the `useHandCursor` property to `false`, in
	 * which case the pointer is displayed.
	 *
	 * Although it is better to use the SimpleButton class to create buttons,
	 * you can use the `buttonMode` property to give a sprite some
	 * button-like functionality. To include a sprite in the tab order, set the
	 * `tabEnabled` property(inherited from the InteractiveObject
	 * class and `false` by default) to `true`.
	 * Additionally, consider whether you want the children of your sprite to be
	 * user input enabled. Most buttons do not enable user input interactivity
	 * for their child objects because it confuses the event flow. To disable
	 * user input interactivity for all child objects, you must set the
	 * `mouseChildren` property(inherited from the
	 * DisplayObjectContainer class) to `false`.
	 *
	 * If you use the `buttonMode` property with the MovieClip
	 * class(which is a subclass of the Sprite class), your button might have
	 * some added functionality. If you include frames labeled _up, _over, and
	 * _down, Flash Player provides automatic state changes(functionality
	 * similar to that provided in previous versions of ActionScript for movie
	 * clips used as buttons). These automatic state changes are not available
	 * for sprites, which have no timeline, and thus no frames to label.
