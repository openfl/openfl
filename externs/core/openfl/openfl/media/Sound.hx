/**
 * The Sound class lets you work with sound in an application. The Sound class
 * lets you create a Sound object, load and play an external MP3 file into
 * that object, close the sound stream, and access data about the sound, such
 * as information about the number of bytes in the stream and ID3 metadata.
 * More detailed control of the sound is performed through the sound source
 *  -  the SoundChannel or Microphone object for the sound  -  and through the
 * properties in the SoundTransform class that control the output of the sound
 * to the computer's speakers.
 *
 * In Flash Player 10 and later and AIR 1.5 and later, you can also use
 * this class to work with sound that is generated dynamically. In this case,
 * the Sound object uses the function you assign to a `sampleData`
 * event handler to poll for sound data. The sound is played as it is
 * retrieved from a ByteArray object that you populate with sound data. You
 * can use `Sound.extract()` to extract sound data from a Sound
 * object, after which you can manipulate it before writing it back to the
 * stream for playback.
 *
 * To control sounds that are embedded in a SWF file, use the properties in
 * the SoundMixer class.
 *
 * **Note**: The ActionScript 3.0 Sound API differs from ActionScript
 * 2.0. In ActionScript 3.0, you cannot take sound objects and arrange them in
 * a hierarchy to control their properties.
 *
 * When you use this class, consider the following security model: 
 *
 * 
 *  * Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in
 * a network sandbox and the sound file to be loaded is local.
 *  * By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling
 * file is local and tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant
 * explicit permission to allow this type of access.
 *  * Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a
 * loaded sound cannot be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you
 * implement a cross-domain policy file. Sound-related APIs that fall under
 * this restriction are `Sound.id3`,
 * `SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()`,
 * `SoundMixer.bufferTime`, and the `SoundTransform`
 * class.
 * 
 *
 * However, in Adobe AIR, content in the `application` security
 * sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
 * these security limitations.
 *
 * For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer
 * Center Topic: [Security](http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en).
 * 
 * @event complete   Dispatched when data has loaded successfully.
 * @event id3        Dispatched by a Sound object when ID3 data is available
 *                   for an MP3 sound.
 * @event ioError    Dispatched when an input/output error occurs that causes
 *                   a load operation to fail.
 * @event open       Dispatched when a load operation starts.
 * @event progress   Dispatched when data is received as a load operation
 *                   progresses.
 * @event sampleData Dispatched when the runtime requests new audio data.

	/**
	 * Provides access to the metadata that is part of an MP3 file.
	 *
	 * MP3 sound files can contain ID3 tags, which provide metadata about the
	 * file. If an MP3 sound that you load using the `Sound.load()`
	 * method contains ID3 tags, you can query these properties. Only ID3 tags
	 * that use the UTF-8 character set are supported.
	 *
	 * Flash Player 9 and later and AIR support ID3 2.0 tags, specifically 2.3
	 * and 2.4. The following tables list the standard ID3 2.0 tags and the type
	 * of content the tags represent. The `Sound.id3` property
	 * provides access to these tags through the format
	 * `my_sound.id3.COMM`, `my_sound.id3.TIME`, and so on.
	 * The first table describes tags that can be accessed either through the ID3
	 * 2.0 property name or the ActionScript property name. The second table
	 * describes ID3 tags that are supported but do not have predefined
	 * properties in ActionScript. 
	 *
	 * When using this property, consider the Flash Player security model:
	 *
	 * 
	 *  * The `id3` property of a Sound object is always permitted
	 * for SWF files that are in the same security sandbox as the sound file. For
	 * files in other sandboxes, there are security checks.
	 *  * When you load the sound, using the `load()` method of the
	 * Sound class, you can specify a `context` parameter, which is a
	 * SoundLoaderContext object. If you set the `checkPolicyFile`
	 * property of the SoundLoaderContext object to `true`, Flash
	 * Player checks for a URL policy file on the server from which the sound is
	 * loaded. If a policy file exists and permits access from the domain of the
	 * loading SWF file, then the file is allowed to access the `id3`
	 * property of the Sound object; otherwise it is not.
	 * 
	 *
	 * However, in Adobe AIR, content in the `application` security
	 * sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
	 * these security limitations.
