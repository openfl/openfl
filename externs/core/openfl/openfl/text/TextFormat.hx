/**
 * The TextFormat class represents character formatting information. Use the
 * TextFormat class to create specific text formatting for text fields. You
 * can apply text formatting to both static and dynamic text fields. The
 * properties of the TextFormat class apply to device and embedded fonts.
 * However, for embedded fonts, bold and italic text actually require specific
 * fonts. If you want to display bold or italic text with an embedded font,
 * you need to embed the bold and italic variations of that font.
 *
 *  You must use the constructor `new TextFormat()` to create a
 * TextFormat object before setting its properties. When you apply a
 * TextFormat object to a text field using the
 * `TextField.defaultTextFormat` property or the
 * `TextField.setTextFormat()` method, only its defined properties
 * are applied. Use the `TextField.defaultTextFormat` property to
 * apply formatting BEFORE you add text to the `TextField`, and the
 * `setTextFormat()` method to add formatting AFTER you add text to
 * the `TextField`. The TextFormat properties are `null`
 * by default because if you don't provide values for the properties, Flash
 * Player uses its own default formatting. The default formatting that Flash
 * Player uses for each property(if property's value is `null`) is
 * as follows:
 *
 * The default formatting for each property is also described in each
 * property description.
