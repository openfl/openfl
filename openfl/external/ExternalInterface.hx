/**
 * The ExternalInterface class is an application programming interface that
 * enables straightforward communication between ActionScript and the SWF
 * container– for example, an HTML page with JavaScript or a desktop
 * application that uses Flash Player to display a SWF file.
 *
 * <p>Using the ExternalInterface class, you can call an ActionScript function
 * in the Flash runtime, using JavaScript in the HTML page. The ActionScript
 * function can return a value, and JavaScript receives it immediately as the
 * return value of the call.</p>
 *
 * <p>This functionality replaces the <code>fscommand()</code> method.</p>
 *
 * <p>Use the ExternalInterface class in the following combinations of browser
 * and operating system:</p>
 *
 * <p>The ExternalInterface class requires the user's web browser to support
 * either ActiveX<sup>®</sup> or the NPRuntime API that is exposed by some
 * browsers for plug-in scripting. Even if a browser and operating system
 * combination are not listed above, they should support the ExternalInterface
 * class if they support the NPRuntime API. See <a
 * href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/plugins/npruntime.html"
 * scope="external">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/plugins/npruntime.html</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> When embedding SWF files within an HTML page, make sure
 * that the <code>id</code> attribute is set and the <code>id</code> and
 * <code>name</code> attributes of the <code>object</code> and
 * <code>embed</code> tags do not include the following characters:</p>
 * <pre xml:space="preserve"> . - + ~~ / \ </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Note for Flash Player applications:</b> Flash Player version
 * 9.0.115.0 and later allows the <code>.</code>(period) character within the
 * <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> attributes.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note for Flash Player applications:</b> In Flash Player 10 and later
 * running in a browser, using this class programmatically to open a pop-up
 * window may not be successful. Various browsers(and browser configurations)
 * may block pop-up windows at any time; it is not possible to guarantee any
 * pop-up window will appear. However, for the best chance of success, use
 * this class to open a pop-up window only in code that executes as a direct
 * result of a user action(for example, in an event handler for a mouse click
 * or key-press event.)</p>
 *
 * <p>From ActionScript, you can do the following on the HTML page:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Call any JavaScript function.</li>
 *   <li>Pass any number of arguments, with any names.</li>
 *   <li>Pass various data types(Boolean, Number, String, and so on).</li>
 *   <li>Receive a return value from the JavaScript function.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>From JavaScript on the HTML page, you can:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Call an ActionScript function.</li>
 *   <li>Pass arguments using standard function call notation.</li>
 *   <li>Return a value to the JavaScript function.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note for Flash Player applications:</b> Flash Player does not
 * currently support SWF files embedded within HTML forms.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note for AIR applications:</b> In Adobe AIR, the ExternalInterface
 * class can be used to communicate between JavaScript in an HTML page loaded
 * in the HTMLLoader control and ActionScript in SWF content embedded in that
 * HTML page.</p>
