/**
 * The TouchEvent class lets you handle events on devices that detect user
 * contact with the device(such as a finger on a touch screen). When a user
 * interacts with a device such as a mobile phone or tablet with a touch
 * screen, the user typically touches the screen with his or her fingers or a
 * pointing device. You can develop applications that respond to basic touch
 * events(such as a single finger tap) with the TouchEvent class. Create
 * event listeners using the event types defined in this class. For user
 * interaction with multiple points of contact(such as several fingers moving
 * across a touch screen at the same time) use the related GestureEvent,
 * PressAndTapGestureEvent, and TransformGestureEvent classes. And, use the
 * properties and methods of these classes to construct event handlers that
 * respond to the user touching the device.
 *
 * <p>Use the Multitouch class to determine the current environment's support
 * for touch interaction, and to manage the support of touch interaction if
 * the current environment supports it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> When objects are nested on the display list, touch events
 * target the deepest possible nested object that is visible in the display
 * list. This object is called the target node. To have a target node's
 * ancestor(an object containing the target node in the display list) receive
 * notification of a touch event, use
 * <code>EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</code> on the ancestor node with
 * the type parameter set to the specific touch event you want to detect.</p>
