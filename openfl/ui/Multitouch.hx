/**
 * The Multitouch class manages and provides information about the current
 * environment's support for handling contact from user input devices,
 * including contact that has two or more touch points(such as a user's
 * fingers on a touch screen). When a user interacts with a device such as a
 * mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen, the user typically touches the
 * screen with his or her fingers or a pointing device. While there is a broad
 * range of pointing devices, such as a mouse or a stylus, many of these
 * devices only have a single point of contact with an application. For
 * pointing devices with a single point of contact, user interaction events
 * can be handled as a mouse event, or using a basic set of touch events
 * (called "touch point" events). However, for pointing devices that have
 * several points of contact and perform complex movement, such as the human
 * hand, Flash runtimes support an additional set of event handling API called
 * gesture events. The API for handling user interaction with these gesture
 * events includes the following classes:
 *
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>flash.events.TouchEvent</li>
 *   <li>flash.events.GestureEvent</li>
 *   <li>flash.events.GesturePhase</li>
 *   <li>flash.events.TransformGestureEvent</li>
 *   <li>flash.events.PressAndTapGestureEvent</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Use the listed classes to write code that handles touch events. Use the
 * Multitouch class to determine the current environment's support for touch
 * interaction, and to manage the support of touch interaction if the current
 * environment supports touch input.</p>
 *
 * <p>You cannot create a Multitouch object directly from ActionScript code.
 * If you call <code>new Multitouch()</code>, an exception is thrown.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The Multitouch feature is not supported for SWF files
 * embedded in HTML running on Mac OS.</p>
