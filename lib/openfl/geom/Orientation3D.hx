		The axis angle orientation uses a combination of an axis and an angle to determine
		the orientation. A line or vector from the center of a three-dimensional globe to
		the surface is an example of an axis. The axis around which the object is rotated
		is a unit vector that represents any possible direction in the three-dimensional
		space. The angle represents the magnitude of the rotation about the vector. The
		direction determines where a display object is facing and the roll angle
		determines which way is up. You can use Vector3D and the Matrix3D objects to
		determine the various matrix transformations as well as to determine important
		three-dimensional programming values such as the distance to the intersection of
		two objects that can be used to detect simple collision between three-dimensional
		objects.

		The Matrix3D `appendRotation()` and Matrix3D `prependRotation()` methods use the
		axis angle orientation.

		Euler angles, the default orientation for `decompose()` and `recompose()` methods,
		defines the orientation with three separate angles of rotation for each axis.
		Usually, a rotation around the x axis is followed by a rotation around the y axis,
		which is followed by a rotation around the z axis.

		Euler angles can sometimes lead to animation errors because of problems such as
		singularities when rotating around the x axis or gimbal lock. For example, since
		with Euler angles each axis is handled independently, gimbal lock can occur during
		the rotation around two or more axes. The axes can become aligned, leading to
		unexpected results.

		The axis rotation properties of the display object perform Euler angles rotation.

		The quaternion orientation uses complex numbers. An orientation in quaternion is
		by the three axes of rotation (x,y,z) and an angle of rotation (w). Quaternion
		guarantees the shortest, most efficient path for the rotation. It also produces a
		smooth, gimbal-lock-free rotation. A gimbal lock can occur when during the
		rotation around two or more axes the axes are aligned, leading to unexpected
		results.

		The Matrix3D `interpolate()` method uses quaternion.
