	Defines an ordered set of triangles that can be rendered using either

	represented by three sets of (x, y) coordinates, each of which is one
	point of the triangle.
	The triangle vertices do not contain z coordinates and do not necessarily
	represent 3D faces. However a triangle path can be used to support the
	rendering of 3D geometry in a 2D space.

		If the length of this vector is three times the length of the
