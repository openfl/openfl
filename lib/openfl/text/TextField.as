	 * @externs
	 * The TextField class is used to create display objects for text display and
	 * input. <ph outputclass="flexonly">You can use the TextField class to
	 * perform low-level text rendering. However, in Flex, you typically use the
	 * Label, Text, TextArea, and TextInput controls to process text. <ph
	 * outputclass="flashonly">You can give a text field an instance name in the
	 * Property inspector and use the methods and properties of the TextField
	 * class to manipulate it with ActionScript. TextField instance names are
	 * displayed in the Movie Explorer and in the Insert Target Path dialog box in
	 * the Actions panel.
	 *
	 * To create a text field dynamically, use the `TextField()`
	 * constructor.
	 *
	 * The methods of the TextField class let you set, select, and manipulate
	 * text in a dynamic or input text field that you create during authoring or
	 * at runtime. 
	 *
	 * ActionScript provides several ways to format your text at runtime. The
	 * TextFormat class lets you set character and paragraph formatting for
	 * TextField objects. You can apply Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) styles to
	 * text fields by using the `TextField.styleSheet` property and the
	 * StyleSheet class. You can use CSS to style built-in HTML tags, define new
	 * formatting tags, or apply styles. You can assign HTML formatted text, which
	 * optionally uses CSS styles, directly to a text field. HTML text that you
	 * assign to a text field can contain embedded media(movie clips, SWF files,
	 * GIF files, PNG files, and JPEG files). The text wraps around the embedded
	 * media in the same way that a web browser wraps text around media embedded
	 * in an HTML document. 
	 *
	 * Flash Player supports a subset of HTML tags that you can use to format
	 * text. See the list of supported HTML tags in the description of the
	 * `htmlText` property.
	 * 
	 * @event change                    Dispatched after a control value is
	 *                                  modified, unlike the
	 *                                  `textInput` event, which is
	 *                                  dispatched before the value is modified.
	 *                                  Unlike the W3C DOM Event Model version of
	 *                                  the `change` event, which
	 *                                  dispatches the event only after the
	 *                                  control loses focus, the ActionScript 3.0
	 *                                  version of the `change` event
	 *                                  is dispatched any time the control
	 *                                  changes. For example, if a user types text
	 *                                  into a text field, a `change`
	 *                                  event is dispatched after every keystroke.
	 * @event link                      Dispatched when a user clicks a hyperlink
	 *                                  in an HTML-enabled text field, where the
	 *                                  URL begins with "event:". The remainder of
	 *                                  the URL after "event:" is placed in the
	 *                                  text property of the LINK event.
	 *
	 *                                  **Note:** The default behavior,
	 *                                  adding the text to the text field, occurs
	 *                                  only when Flash Player generates the
	 *                                  event, which in this case happens when a
	 *                                  user attempts to input text. You cannot
	 *                                  put text into a text field by sending it
	 *                                  `textInput` events.
	 * @event scroll                    Dispatched by a TextField object
	 *                                  _after_ the user scrolls.
	 * @event textInput                 Flash Player dispatches the
	 *                                  `textInput` event when a user
	 *                                  enters one or more characters of text.
	 *                                  Various text input methods can generate

	 *                                  input method editors(IMEs), voice or
	 *                                  speech recognition systems, and even the
