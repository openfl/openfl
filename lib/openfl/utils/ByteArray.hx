	 * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt).
	 *
	 * The deflate compression algorithm is used in several compression
	 * formats, such as zlib, gzip, some zip implementations, and others. When
	 * data is compressed using one of those compression formats, in addition to
	 * storing the compressed version of the original data, the compression
	 * format data(for example, the .zip file) includes metadata information.
	 * Some examples of the types of metadata included in various file formats
	 * are file name, file modification date/time, original file size, optional
	 * comments, checksum data, and more.
	 *
	 * For example, when a ByteArray is compressed using the zlib algorithm,
	 * the resulting ByteArray is structured in a specific format. Certain bytes
	 * contain metadata about the compressed data, while other bytes contain the
	 * actual compressed version of the original ByteArray data. As defined by
	 * the zlib compressed data format specification, those bytes(that is, the
	 * portion containing the compressed version of the original data) are
	 * compressed using the deflate algorithm. Consequently those bytes are
	 * identical to the result of calling `compress(<ph
	 * outputclass="javascript">air.CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` on the
	 * original ByteArray. However, the result from `compress(<ph
	 * outputclass="javascript">air.CompressionAlgorithm.ZLIB)` includes
	 * the extra metadata, while the
	 * `compress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` result includes only
	 * the compressed version of the original ByteArray data and nothing
	 * else.
	 *
	 * In order to use the deflate format to compress a ByteArray instance's
	 * data in a specific format such as gzip or zip, you cannot simply call
	 * `compress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)`. You must create a
	 * ByteArray structured according to the compression format's specification,
	 * including the appropriate metadata as well as the compressed data obtained
	 * using the deflate format. Likewise, in order to decode data compressed in
	 * a format such as gzip or zip, you can't simply call
	 * `uncompress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` on that data. First,
	 * you must separate the metadata from the compressed data, and you can then
	 * use the deflate format to decompress the compressed data.
