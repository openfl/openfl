/**
	The Clipboard class provides a container for transferring data and objects
	through the clipboard. The operating system clipboard can be accessed
	through the static `generalClipboard` property.
	A Clipboard object can contain the same information in more than one
	format. By supplying information in multiple formats, you increase the
	chances that another application will be able to use that information. Add
	data to a Clipboard object with the `setData()` or `setDataHandler()`
	method.

	The standard formats are:

	* BITMAP_FORMAT: a BitmapData object (AIR only)
	* FILE_LIST_FORMAT: an array of File objects (AIR only)
	* HTML_FORMAT: HTML-formatted string data
	* TEXT_FORMAT: string data
	* RICH_TEXT_FORMAT: a ByteArray containing Rich Text Format data
	* URL_FORMAT: a URL string (AIR only)

	These constants for the names of the standard formats are defined in the
	ClipboardFormats class.

	When a transfer to or from the operating system occurs, the standard
	formats are automatically translated between ActionScript data types and
	the native operating system clipboard types.

	You can use application-defined formats to add ActionScript objects to a
	Clipboard object. If an object is serializable, both a reference and a
	clone of the object can be made available. Object references are valid
	only within the originating application.

	When it is computationally expensive to convert the information to be
	transferred into a particular format, you can supply the name of a
	function that performs the conversion. The function is called if and only
	if that format is read by the receiving component or application. Add a
	deferred rendering function to a Clipboard object with the
		`setDataHandler()` method. Note that in some cases, the operating system
	calls the function before a drop occurs. For example, when you use a
	handler function to provide the data for a file dragged from an AIR
	application to the file system, the operating system calls the data
	handler function as soon as the drag gesture leaves the AIR
	application - typically resulting in an undesireable pause as the file
	data is downloaded or created.

	**Note for AIR applications:** The clipboard object referenced by the
	event objects dispatched for HTML drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste events
	are not the same type as the AIR Clipboard object. The JavaScript
	clipboard object is described in the AIR developer's guide.

	**Note for Flash Player applications:** In Flash Player 10, a paste
	operation from the clipboard first requires a user event (such as a
	keyboard shortcut for the Paste command or a mouse click on the Paste
	command in a context menu). `Clipboard.getData()` will return the contents
	of the clipboard only if the InteractiveObject has received and is acting
	on a paste event. Calling `Clipboard.getData()` under any other
	circumstances will be unsuccessful. The same restriction applies in AIR
	for content outside the application sandbox.

	On Linux, clipboard data does not persist when an AIR application closes.

		Adds a representation of the information to be transferred in the
		specified data format.
		In the application sandbox of Adobe AIR, `setData()` can be called
		anytime. In other contexts, `setData()` can only be called in response
		to a user-generated event such as a key press or mouse click.

		Different representations of the same information can be added to the
		clipboard as different formats, which increases the ability of other
		components or applications to make use of the available data. For
		example, an image could be added as bitmap data for use by image
		editing applications, as a URL, and as an encoded PNG file for
		transfer to the native file system.

		The data parameter must be the appropriate data type for the specified
		format:

		| Format | Type | Description |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| `ClipboardFormats.TEXT_FORMAT` | `String` | string data |
		| `ClipboardFormats.HTML_FORMAT` | `String` | HTML string data |
		| `ClipboardFormats.URL_FORMAT` | `String` | URL string (AIR only) |
		| `ClipboardFormats.RICH_TEXT_FORMAT` | `ByteArray` | Rich Text Format data |
		| `ClipboardFormats.BITMAP_FORMAT` | `BitmapData` | bitmap data (AIR only) |
		| `ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT` | array of `File` | an array of files (AIR only) |
		| Custom format name | any | object reference and serialized clone |

		Custom format names cannot begin with "air:" or "flash:". To prevent
		name collisions when using custom formats, you may want to use your
		application ID or a package name as a prefix to the format, such as
		"com.example.applicationName.dataPacket".

		When transferring within or between applications, the `serializable`
		parameter determines whether both a reference and a copy are
		available, or whether only a reference to an object is available. Set
		`serializable` to `true` to make both the reference and a copy of the
		data object available. Set `serializable` to `false` to make only the
		object reference available. Object references are valid only within
		the current application so setting `serializable` to `false` also
		means that the data in that format is not available to other Flash
		Player or AIR applications. A component can choose to get the
		reference or the copy of the object by setting the appropriate
		clipboard transfer mode when accessing the data for that format.

		**Note:** The standard formats are always converted to native formats
		when data is pasted or dragged outside a supported application, so the
		value of the `serializable` parameter does not affect the availability
		of data in the standard formats to non-Flash-based applications.

		To defer rendering of the data for a format, use the
		`setDataHandler()` method instead. If both the `setData()` and the
		`setDataHandler()` methods are used to add a data representation with
		the same format name, then the handler function will never be called.

		**Note:** On Mac OS, when you set the `format` parameter to
		`ClipboardFormats.URL_FORMAT`, the URL is transferred only if it is a
		valid URL. Otherwise, the Clipboard object is emptied (and calling
		`getData()` returns `null`).

		@param format       The format of the data.
		@param data         The information to add.
		@param serializable Specify `true` for objects that can be serialized
							(and deserialized).
		@return `true` if the data was succesfully set; `false` otherwise. In

				`ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT`,
				`ClipboardFormats.FILE_PROMISE_LIST_FORMAT`, or
				`ClipboardFormats.BITMAP_FORMAT`).

									  longer in scope (which can occur with
									  clipboards created for drag-and-drop
									  operations).

		Adds a reference to a handler function that produces the data to be
		transfered.
		Use a handler function to defer creation or rendering of the data
		until it is actually accessed.

		The handler function must return the appropriate data type for the
		specified format:

		| Format | Return Type |
		| --- | --- |
		| `ClipboardFormats.TEXT_FORMAT` | `String` |
		| `ClipboardFormats.HTML_FORMAT` | `String` |

		| `ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT` | Array of `File` (AIR only) |
		| `ClipboardFormats.FILE_PROMISE_LIST_FORMAT` | Array of `File` (AIR only) |
		| Custom format name | Non-void |

		The handler function is called when and only when the data in the
		specified format is read. Note that in some cases, the operating
		system calls the function before a drop occurs. For example, when you
		use a handler function to provide the data for a file dragged from an
		AIR application to the file system, the operating system calls the
		data handler function as soon as the drag gesture leaves the AIR
		application�typically resulting in an undesireable pause as the file
		data is downloaded or created. You can use a URLFilePromise for this
		purpose instead.

		Note that the underlying data can change between the time the handler
		is added and the time the data is read unless your application takes
		steps to protect the data. The behavior that occurs when data on the
		clipboard represented by a handler function is read more than once is
		not guaranteed. The clipboard might return the data produced by the
		first function call or it might call the function again. Do not rely
		on either behavior.

		In the application sandbox of Adobe AIR, `setDataHandler()` can be
		called anytime. In other contexts, `setDataHandler()` can only be
		called in response to a user-generated event such as a key press or
		mouse click.

		To add data directly to this Clipboard object, use the `setData()`
		method instead. If both the `setData()` and the `setDataHandler()`
		methods are called with the same format name, then the handler
		function is never called.

		**Note:** On Mac OS, when you set the `format` parameter to
		`ClipboardFormats.URL_FORMAT`, the URL is transferred only if the
		handler function returns a valid URL. Otherwise, the Clipboard object
		is emptied (and calling `getData()` returns `null`).
