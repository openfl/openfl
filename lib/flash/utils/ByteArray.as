		 *
		 * The deflate compression algorithm is described at 
		 * [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt).
		 *
		 * The deflate compression algorithm is used in several compression
		 * formats, such as zlib, gzip, some zip implementations, and others. When
		 * data is compressed using one of those compression formats, in addition to
		 * storing the compressed version of the original data, the compression
		 * format data(for example, the .zip file) includes metadata information.
		 * Some examples of the types of metadata included in various file formats
		 * are file name, file modification date/time, original file size, optional
		 * comments, checksum data, and more.
		 *
		 * For example, when a ByteArray is compressed using the zlib algorithm,
		 * the resulting ByteArray is structured in a specific format. Certain bytes
		 * contain metadata about the compressed data, while other bytes contain the
		 * actual compressed version of the original ByteArray data. As defined by
		 * the zlib compressed data format specification, those bytes(that is, the
		 * portion containing the compressed version of the original data) are
		 * compressed using the deflate algorithm. Consequently those bytes are
		 * identical to the result of calling `compress(<ph
		 * outputclass="javascript">air.CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` on the
		 * original ByteArray. However, the result from `compress(<ph
		 * outputclass="javascript">air.CompressionAlgorithm.ZLIB)` includes
		 * the extra metadata, while the
		 * `compress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` result includes only
		 * the compressed version of the original ByteArray data and nothing
		 * else.
		 *
		 * In order to use the deflate format to compress a ByteArray instance's
		 * data in a specific format such as gzip or zip, you cannot simply call
		 * `compress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)`. You must create a
		 * ByteArray structured according to the compression format's specification,
		 * including the appropriate metadata as well as the compressed data obtained
		 * using the deflate format. Likewise, in order to decode data compressed in
		 * a format such as gzip or zip, you can't simply call
		 * `uncompress(CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE)` on that data. First,
		 * you must separate the metadata from the compressed data, and you can then
		 * use the deflate format to decompress the compressed data.
