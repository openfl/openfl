	/**
	 * @externs
	 * The MovieClip class inherits from the following classes: Sprite,
	 * DisplayObjectContainer, InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and
	 * EventDispatcher.
	 *
	 * Unlike the Sprite object, a MovieClip object has a timeline.
	 *
	 * In Flash Professional, the methods for the MovieClip class provide the
	 * same functionality as actions that target movie clips. Some additional
	 * methods do not have equivalent actions in the Actions toolbox in the
	 * Actions panel in the Flash authoring tool. 
	 *
	 * Children instances placed on the Stage in Flash Professional cannot be
	 * accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent instance since
	 * they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before
	 * accessing the child, the parent must instead either create the child
	 * instance by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for
	 * the child to dispatch its `Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE` event.
	 *
	 * If you modify any of the following properties of a MovieClip object that
	 * contains a motion tween, the playhead is stopped in that MovieClip object:
	 * `alpha`, `blendMode`, `filters`,
	 * `height`, `opaqueBackground`, `rotation`,
	 * `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `scale9Grid`,
	 * `scrollRect`, `transform`, `visible`,
	 * `width`, `x`, or `y`. However, it does not
	 * stop the playhead in any child MovieClip objects of that MovieClip
	 * object.
	 *
	 * **Note:**Flash Lite 4 supports the MovieClip.opaqueBackground
	 * property only if FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE is defined. The default configuration
	 * of Flash Lite 4 does not define FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE. To enable the
	 * MovieClip.opaqueBackground property for a suitable device, define
	 * FEATURE_BITMAPCACHE in your project.
