/**
 * The SharedObject class is used to read and store limited amounts of data on
 * a user's computer or on a server. Shared objects offer real-time data
 * sharing between multiple client SWF files and objects that are persistent
 * on the local computer or remote server. Local shared objects are similar to
 * browser cookies and remote shared objects are similar to real-time data
 * transfer devices. To use remote shared objects, you need Adobe Flash Media
 * Server.
 *
 * Use shared objects to do the following:
 *
 * 
 *  * **Maintain local persistence**. This is the simplest way to use a
 * shared object, and does not require Flash Media Server. For example, you
 * can call `SharedObject.getLocal()` to create a shared object in
 * an application, such as a calculator with memory. When the user closes the
 * calculator, Flash Player saves the last value in a shared object on the
 * user's computer. The next time the calculator is run, it contains the
 * values it had previously. Alternatively, if you set the shared object's
 * properties to `null` before the calculator application is
 * closed, the next time the application runs, it opens without any values.
 * Another example of maintaining local persistence is tracking user
 * preferences or other data for a complex website, such as a record of which
 * articles a user read on a news site. Tracking this information allows you
 * to display articles that have already been read differently from new,
 * unread articles. Storing this information on the user's computer reduces
 * server load.
 *  * **Store and share data on Flash Media Server**. A shared object
 * can store data on the server for other clients to retrieve. For example,
 * call `SharedObject.getRemote()` to create a remote shared
 * object, such as a phone list, that is persistent on the server. Whenever a
 * client makes changes to the shared object, the revised data is available to
 * all clients currently connected to the object or who later connect to it.
 * If the object is also persistent locally, and a client changes data while
 * not connected to the server, the data is copied to the remote shared object
 * the next time the client connects to the object.
 *  * **Share data in real time**. A shared object can share data among
 * multiple clients in real time. For example, you can open a remote shared
 * object that stores a list of users connected to a chat room that is visible
 * to all clients connected to the object. When a user enters or leaves the
 * chat room, the object is updated and all clients that are connected to the
 * object see the revised list of chat room users.
 * 
 *
 *  To create a local shared object, call
 * `SharedObject.getLocal()`. To create a remote shared object,
 * call `SharedObject.getRemote()`.
 *
 *  When an application closes, shared objects are _flushed_, or
 * written to a disk. You can also call the `flush()` method to
 * explicitly write data to a disk.
 *
 * **Local disk space considerations.** Local shared objects have some
 * limitations that are important to consider as you design your application.
 * Sometimes SWF files may not be allowed to write local shared objects, and
 * sometimes the data stored in local shared objects can be deleted without
 * your knowledge. Flash Player users can manage the disk space that is
 * available to individual domains or to all domains. When users decrease the
 * amount of disk space available, some local shared objects may be deleted.
 * Flash Player users also have privacy controls that can prevent third-party
 * domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
 * from reading or writing local shared objects.
 *
 * **Note**: SWF files that are stored and run on a local computer, not
 * from a remote server, can always write third-party shared objects to disk.
 * For more information about third-party shared objects, see the 
 * [Global Storage Settings panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)
 * in Flash Player Help.
 *
 * It's a good idea to check for failures related to the amount of disk
 * space and to user privacy controls. Perform these checks when you call
 * `getLocal()` and `flush()`:
 * 
 *  * `SharedObject.getLocal()`  -  Flash Player throws an
 * exception when a call to this method fails, such as when the user has
 * disabled third-party shared objects and the domain of your SWF file does
 * not match the domain in the browser address bar.
 *  * `SharedObject.flush()`  -  Flash Player throws an
 * exception when a call to this method fails. It returns
 * `SharedObjectFlushStatus.FLUSHED` when it succeeds. It returns
 * `SharedObjectFlushStatus.PENDING` when additional storage space
 * is needed. Flash Player prompts the user to allow an increase in storage
 * space for locally saved information. Thereafter, the `netStatus`
 * event is dispatched with an information object indicating whether the flush
 * failed or succeeded.
 * 
 * 
 *
 * If your SWF file attempts to create or modify local shared objects, make
 * sure that your SWF file is at least 215 pixels wide and at least 138 pixels
 * high(the minimum dimensions for displaying the dialog box that prompts
 * users to increase their local shared object storage limit). If your SWF
 * file is smaller than these dimensions and an increase in the storage limit
 * is required, `SharedObject.flush()` fails, returning
 * `SharedObjectFlushedStatus.PENDING` and dispatching the
 * `netStatus` event.
 *
 *  **Remote shared objects.** With Flash Media Server, you can create
 * and use remote shared objects, that are shared in real-time by all clients
 * connected to your application. When one client changes a property of a
 * remote shared object, the property is changed for all connected clients.
 * You can use remote shared objects to synchronize clients, for example,
 * users in a multi-player game. 
 *
 *  Each remote shared object has a `data` property which is an
 * Object with properties that store data. Call `setProperty()` to
 * change an property of the data object. The server updates the properties,
 * dispatches a `sync` event, and sends the properties back to the
 * connected clients. 
 *
 *  You can choose to make remote shared objects persistent on the client,
 * the server, or both. By default, Flash Player saves locally persistent
 * remote shared objects up to 100K in size. When you try to save a larger
 * object, Flash Player displays the Local Storage dialog box, which lets the
 * user allow or deny local storage for the shared object. Make sure your
 * Stage size is at least 215 by 138 pixels; this is the minimum size Flash
 * requires to display the dialog box. 
 *
 *  If the user selects Allow, the server saves the shared object and
 * dispatches a `netStatus` event with a `code` property
 * of `SharedObject.Flush.Success`. If the user select Deny, the
 * server does not save the shared object and dispatches a
 * `netStatus` event with a `code` property of
 * `SharedObject.Flush.Failed`. 
 * 
 * @event asyncError Dispatched when an exception is thrown asynchronously  - 
 *                   that is, from native asynchronous code.
 * @event netStatus  Dispatched when a SharedObject instance is reporting its
 *                   status or error condition. The `netStatus`
 *                   event contains an `info` property, which is an
 *                   information object that contains specific information
 *                   about the event, such as whether a connection attempt
 *                   succeeded or whether the shared object was successfully
 *                   written to the local disk.
 * @event sync       Dispatched when a remote shared object has been updated
 *                   by the server.

	 *
	 * For example, if you expect a shared object to grow to a maximum size of

	/**
	 * Returns a reference to a locally persistent shared object that is only
	 * available to the current client. If the shared object does not already
	 * exist, this method creates one. If any values passed to
	 * `getLocal()` are invalid or if the call fails, Flash Player
	 * throws an exception.
	 *
	 * The following code shows how you assign the returned shared object
	 * reference to a variable:
	 *
	 * `var so:SharedObject =
	 * SharedObject.getLocal("savedData");`
	 *
	 * **Note:** If the user has chosen to never allow local storage for
	 * this domain, the object is not saved locally, even if a value for
	 * `localPath` is specified. The exception to this rule is local
	 * content. Local content can always write shared objects from third-party
	 * domains(domains other than the domain in the current browser address bar)
	 * to disk, even if writing of third-party shared objects to disk is
	 * disallowed. 
	 *
	 * To avoid name conflicts, Flash looks at the location of the SWF file
	 * creating the shared object. For example, if a SWF file at
	 * www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf creates a shared object named
	 * `portfolio`, that shared object does not conflict with another
	 * object named `portfolio` that was created by a SWF file at
	 * www.yourCompany.com/photoshoot.swf because the SWF files originate from
	 * different directories. 
	 *
	 * Although the `localPath` parameter is optional, you should
	 * give some thought to its use, especially if other SWF files need to access
	 * the shared object. If the data in the shared object is specific to one SWF
	 * file that will not be moved to another location, then use of the default
	 * value makes sense. If other SWF files need access to the shared object, or
	 * if the SWF file that creates the shared object will later be moved, then
	 * the value of this parameter affects how accessible the shared object will
	 * be. For example, if you create a shared object with `localPath`
	 * set to the default value of the full path to the SWF file, no other SWF
	 * file can access that shared object. If you later move the original SWF
	 * file to another location, not even that SWF file can access the data
	 * already stored in the shared object.
	 *
	 * To avoid inadvertently restricting access to a shared object, use the
	 * `localpath` parameter. The most permissive approach is to set
	 * `localPath` to `/`(slash), which makes the shared
	 * object available to all SWF files in the domain, but increases the
	 * likelihood of name conflicts with other shared objects in the domain. A
	 * more restrictive approach is to append `localPath` with folder
	 * names that are in the full path to the SWF file. For example, for a
	 * `portfolio` shared object created by the SWF file at
	 * www.myCompany.com/apps/stockwatcher.swf, you could set the
	 * `localPath` parameter to `/`, `/apps`, or
	 * `/apps/stockwatcher.swf`. You must determine which approach
	 * provides optimal flexibility for your application.
	 *
	 * When using this method, consider the following security model:
	 * 
	 *  * You cannot access shared objects across sandbox boundaries.
	 *  * Users can restrict shared object access by using the Flash Player
	 * Settings dialog box or the Settings Manager. By default, an application
	 * can create shared objects of up 100 KB of data per domain. Administrators
	 * and users can also place restrictions on the ability to write to the file
	 * system.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *
	 * Suppose you publish SWF file content to be played back as local files
	 * (either locally installed SWF files or EXE files), and you need to access
	 * a specific shared object from more than one local SWF file. In this
	 * situation, be aware that for local files, two different locations might be
	 * used to store shared objects. The domain that is used depends on the
	 * security permissions granted to the local file that created the shared
	 * object. Local files can have three different levels of permissions:
	 *
	 *  1. Access to the local filesystem only.
	 *  2. Access to the network only.
	 *  3. Access to both the network and the local filesystem.
	 *
	 * Local files with access to the local filesystem(level 1 or 3) store
	 * their shared objects in one location. Local files without access to the
	 * local filesystem(level 2) store their shared objects in another
	 * location.
	 *
	 * You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
	 * `allowNetworking` parameter of the the `object` and
	 * `embed` tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF
	 * content.
	 *
	 * For more information, see the Flash Player Developer Center Topic:
	 * [Security](http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en).
	 * 
	 * @param name      The name of the object. The name can include forward
	 *                  slashes(`/`); for example,
	 *                  `work/addresses` is a legal name. Spaces are
	 *                  not allowed in a shared object name, nor are the
	 *                  following characters: `~ % & \
	 *                  ; : " ' , < > ? #`
	 * @param localPath The full or partial path to the SWF file that created the
	 *                  shared object, and that determines where the shared
	 *                  object will be stored locally. If you do not specify this
	 *                  parameter, the full path is used.
	 * @param secure    Determines whether access to this shared object is
	 *                  restricted to SWF files that are delivered over an HTTPS
	 *                  connection. If your SWF file is delivered over HTTPS,
	 *                  this parameter's value has the following effects:
	 *                  
	 *                   * If this parameter is set to `true`,
	 *                  Flash Player creates a new secure shared object or gets a
	 *                  reference to an existing secure shared object. This
	 *                  secure shared object can be read from or written to only
	 *                  by SWF files delivered over HTTPS that call
	 *                  `SharedObject.getLocal()` with the
	 *                  `secure` parameter set to
	 *                  `true`.
	 *                   * If this parameter is set to `false`,
	 *                  Flash Player creates a new shared object or gets a
	 *                  reference to an existing shared object that can be read
	 *                  from or written to by SWF files delivered over non-HTTPS
	 *                  connections.
	 *                  
	 *
	 *                  If your SWF file is delivered over a non-HTTPS
	 *                  connection and you try to set this parameter to
	 *                  `true`, the creation of a new shared object
	 *                 (or the access of a previously created secure shared
	 *                  object) fails and `null` is returned.
	 *                  Regardless of the value of this parameter, the created
	 *                  shared objects count toward the total amount of disk
	 *                  space allowed for a domain.
	 *
	 *                  The following diagram shows the use of the
	 *                  `secure` parameter:
	 * @return A reference to a shared object that is persistent locally and is
	 *         available only to the current client. If Flash Player can't create
	 *         or find the shared object(for example, if `localPath`
	 *         was specified but no such directory exists), this method throws an
	 *         exception.
	 * @throws Error Flash Player cannot create the shared object for whatever
	 *               reason. This error might occur is if persistent shared
	 *               object creation and storage by third-party Flash content is
