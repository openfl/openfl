/**
 * An object dispatches an ErrorEvent object when an error causes an
 * asynchronous operation to fail.
 *
 * The ErrorEvent class defines only one type of `error` event:
 * `ErrorEvent.ERROR`. The ErrorEvent class also serves as the base
 * class for several other error event classes, including the AsyncErrorEvent,
 * IOErrorEvent, SecurityErrorEvent, SQLErrorEvent, and UncaughtErrorEvent
 * classes.
 *
 * You can check for `error` events that do not have any
 * listeners by registering a listener for the `uncaughtError`
 * (UncaughtErrorEvent.UNCAUGHT_ERROR) event.
 *
 * An uncaught error also causes an error dialog box displaying the error
 * event to appear when content is running in the debugger version of Flash
 * Player or the AIR Debug Launcher(ADL) application.
