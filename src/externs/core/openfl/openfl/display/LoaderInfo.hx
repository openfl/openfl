/**
 * The LoaderInfo class provides information about a loaded SWF file or a
 * loaded image file(JPEG, GIF, or PNG). LoaderInfo objects are available for
 * any display object. The information provided includes load progress, the
 * URLs of the loader and loaded content, the number of bytes total for the
 * media, and the nominal height and width of the media.
 *
 * You can access LoaderInfo objects in two ways: 
 *
 * 
 *  * The `contentLoaderInfo` property of a flash.display.Loader
 * object -  The `contentLoaderInfo` property is always available
 * for any Loader object. For a Loader object that has not called the
 * `load()` or `loadBytes()` method, or that has not
 * sufficiently loaded, attempting to access many of the properties of the
 * `contentLoaderInfo` property throws an error.
 *  * The `loaderInfo` property of a display object. 
 * 
 *
 * The `contentLoaderInfo` property of a Loader object provides
 * information about the content that the Loader object is loading, whereas
 * the `loaderInfo` property of a DisplayObject provides
 * information about the root SWF file for that display object. 
 *
 * When you use a Loader object to load a display object(such as a SWF
 * file or a bitmap), the `loaderInfo` property of the display
 * object is the same as the `contentLoaderInfo` property of the
 * Loader object(`DisplayObject.loaderInfo =
 * Loader.contentLoaderInfo`). Because the instance of the main class of
 * the SWF file has no Loader object, the `loaderInfo` property is
 * the only way to access the LoaderInfo for the instance of the main class of
 * the SWF file.
 *
 * The following diagram shows the different uses of the LoaderInfo
 * object - for the instance of the main class of the SWF file, for the
 * `contentLoaderInfo` property of a Loader object, and for the
 * `loaderInfo` property of a loaded object:
 *
 * When a loading operation is not complete, some properties of the
 * `contentLoaderInfo` property of a Loader object are not
 * available. You can obtain some properties, such as
 * `bytesLoaded`, `bytesTotal`, `url`,
 * `loaderURL`, and `applicationDomain`. When the
 * `loaderInfo` object dispatches the `init` event, you
 * can access all properties of the `loaderInfo` object and the
 * loaded image or SWF file.
 *
 * **Note:** All properties of LoaderInfo objects are read-only.
 *
 * The `EventDispatcher.dispatchEvent()` method is not
 * applicable to LoaderInfo objects. If you call `dispatchEvent()`
 * on a LoaderInfo object, an IllegalOperationError exception is thrown.
 * 
 * @event complete   Dispatched when data has loaded successfully. In other
 *                   words, it is dispatched when all the content has been
 *                   downloaded and the loading has finished. The
 *                   `complete` event is always dispatched after
 *                   the `init` event. The `init` event
 *                   is dispatched when the object is ready to access, though
 *                   the content may still be downloading.
 * @event httpStatus Dispatched when a network request is made over HTTP and
 *                   an HTTP status code can be detected.
 * @event init       Dispatched when the properties and methods of a loaded
 *                   SWF file are accessible and ready for use. The content,
 *                   however, can still be downloading. A LoaderInfo object
 *                   dispatches the `init` event when the following
 *                   conditions exist:
 *                   
 *                    * All properties and methods associated with the
 *                   loaded object and those associated with the LoaderInfo
 *                   object are accessible.
 *                    * The constructors for all child objects have
 *                   completed.
 *                    * All ActionScript code in the first frame of the
 *                   loaded SWF's main timeline has been executed.
 *                   
 *
 *                   For example, an `Event.INIT` is dispatched
 *                   when the first frame of a movie or animation is loaded.
 *                   The movie is then accessible and can be added to the
 *                   display list. The complete movie, however, can take
 *                   longer to download. The `Event.COMPLETE` is
 *                   only dispatched once the full movie is loaded.
 *
 *                   The `init` event always precedes the
 *                   `complete` event.
 * @event ioError    Dispatched when an input or output error occurs that
 *                   causes a load operation to fail.
 * @event open       Dispatched when a load operation starts.
 * @event progress   Dispatched when data is received as the download
 *                   operation progresses.
 * @event unload     Dispatched by a LoaderInfo object whenever a loaded
 *                   object is removed by using the `unload()`
 *                   method of the Loader object, or when a second load is
 *                   performed by the same Loader object and the original
 *                   content is removed prior to the load beginning.
