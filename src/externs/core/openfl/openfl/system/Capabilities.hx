/**
 * The Capabilities class provides properties that describe the system and
 * runtime that are hosting the application. For example, a mobile phone's
 * screen might be 100 square pixels, black and white, whereas a PC screen
 * might be 1000 square pixels, color. By using the Capabilities class to
 * determine what capabilities the client has, you can provide appropriate
 * content to as many users as possible. When you know the device's
 * capabilities, you can tell the server to send the appropriate SWF files or
 * tell the SWF file to alter its presentation.
 *
 * However, some capabilities of Adobe AIR are not listed as properties in
 * the Capabilities class. They are properties of other classes:
 * 
 *
 * There is also a `WD` server string that specifies whether
 * windowless mode is disabled. Windowless mode can be disabled in Flash
 * Player due to incompatibility with the web browser or to a user setting in
 * the mms.cfg file. There is no corresponding Capabilities property.
 *
 * All properties of the Capabilities class are read-only.
