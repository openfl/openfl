/**
	Prior to Flash Player 21, the use of video in Stage3D required the use of the Video
	object (which is not hardware accelerated), copying of video frame to a BitmapData
	object, and loading of the data onto the GPU which is CPU intensive. Thus, Video
	texture object was introduced. It allows hardware decoded video to be used in Stage 3D
	content.

	For Flash Player 22, video texture objects were added to support NetStream and Cameras
	in a manner consistent/ similar to StageVideo. Such textures can be used as source
	textures in the stage3D rendering pipeline. The textures can be used as rectangular,
	RGB, no mipmap textures in the rendering of a scene. They are treated as ARGB texture
	by the shaders (that is, the AGAL shaders do not have to bother about YUV->RGB
	conversion) and so the standard shaders with static images can be used without change.
	The image used by the rendering pipeline is the latest up-to-date frame at the time the
	rendering occurs using this texture. There is no tearing in a video frame, however if
	the same texture is used several times, some of the instances may be from different
	timestamps.
