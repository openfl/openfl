/**
	The EventDispatcher class is the base class for all classes that dispatch
	events. The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface
	and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher
	class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as
	such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.

	Event targets are an important part of the Flash<sup>®</sup> Player and
	Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup> event model. The event target serves as
	the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy.
	When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, Flash Player or
	the AIR application dispatches an event object into the event flow from the
	root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the
	display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins
	its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey to the
	event target is conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase
	comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event
	target's node, the target phase comprises only the event target node, and
	the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return
	trip to the root of the display list.

	In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event
	dispatching capabilities is to extend EventDispatcher. If this is
	impossible(that is, if the class is already extending another class), you
	can instead implement the IEventDispatcher interface, create an
	EventDispatcher member, and write simple hooks to route calls into the
	aggregated EventDispatcher.

	@event activate   [broadcast event] Dispatched when the Flash Player or AIR
					  application gains operating system focus and becomes
					  active. This event is a broadcast event, which means that
					  it is dispatched by all EventDispatcher objects with a
					  listener registered for this event. For more information
					  about broadcast events, see the DisplayObject class.
	@event deactivate [broadcast event] Dispatched when the Flash Player or AIR
					  application operating loses system focus and is becoming
					  inactive. This event is a broadcast event, which means
					  that it is dispatched by all EventDispatcher objects with
					  a listener registered for this event. For more
					  information about broadcast events, see the DisplayObject
					  class.

	/**
		Registers an event listener object with an EventDispatcher object so that
		the listener receives notification of an event. You can register event
		listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event,
		phase, and priority.

		After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change
		its priority through additional calls to `addEventListener()`.
		To change a listener's priority, you must first call
		`removeListener()`. Then you can register the listener again
		with the new priority level.

		Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
		`addEventListener()` with a different `type` or
		`useCapture` value result in the creation of a separate
		listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with
		`useCapture` set to `true`, it listens only during
		the capture phase. If you call `addEventListener()` again using
		the same listener object, but with `useCapture` set to
		`false`, you have two separate listeners: one that listens
		during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
		bubbling phases.

		You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the
		bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because
		bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.

		If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling
		`removeEventListener()`, or memory problems could result. Event
		listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage
		collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object
		exists(unless the `useWeakReference` parameter is set to
		`true`).

		Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners
		attached to it.(If your newly created node needs an event listener, you
		must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an
		EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along
		with it.

		If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is
		being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during
		the current phase but can be triggered during a later phase in the event
		flow, such as the bubbling phase.

		If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being
		processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions. After
		it is removed, the event listener is never invoked again(unless
		registered again for future processing).

		@param type             The type of event.
		@param useCapture       Determines whether the listener works in the
								capture phase or the target and bubbling phases.
								If `useCapture` is set to
								`true`, the listener processes the
								event only during the capture phase and not in the
								target or bubbling phase. If
								`useCapture` is `false`, the
								listener processes the event only during the
								target or bubbling phase. To listen for the event
								in all three phases, call
								`addEventListener` twice, once with
								`useCapture` set to `true`,
								then again with `useCapture` set to
								`false`.
		@param priority         The priority level of the event listener. The
								priority is designated by a signed 32-bit integer.
								The higher the number, the higher the priority.
								All listeners with priority _n_ are processed
								before listeners of priority _n_-1. If two or
								more listeners share the same priority, they are
								processed in the order in which they were added.
								The default priority is 0.
		@param useWeakReference Determines whether the reference to the listener
								is strong or weak. A strong reference(the
								default) prevents your listener from being
								garbage-collected. A weak reference does not.

								Class-level member functions are not subject to
								garbage collection, so you can set
								`useWeakReference` to `true`
								for class-level member functions without
								subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
								`useWeakReference` to `true`
								for a listener that is a nested inner function,
								the function will be garbage-collected and no
								longer persistent. If you create references to the
								inner function(save it in another variable) then
								it is not garbage-collected and stays
								persistent.
		@throws ArgumentError The `listener` specified is not a
							  function.
