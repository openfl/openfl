	A ProgressEvent object is dispatched when a load operation has begun or a
	socket has received data. These events are usually generated when SWF
	files, images or data are loaded into an application. There are two types
	of progress events: `ProgressEvent.PROGRESS` and
	`ProgressEvent.SOCKET_DATA`. Additionally, in AIR ProgressEvent
	objects are dispatched when a data is sent to or from a child process using
	the NativeProcess class.
