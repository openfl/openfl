/**
	A FileStream object is used to read and write files. Files can be opened synchronously
	by calling the open() method or asynchronously by calling the openAsync() method.

	The advantage of opening files asynchronously is that other code can execute while Adobe
	AIR runs read and write processes in the background. When opened asynchronously, progress
	events are dispatched as operations proceed.

	A File object that is opened synchronously behaves much like a ByteArray object; a file
	opened asynchronously behaves much like a Socket or URLStream object. When a File object
	is opened synchronously, the caller pauses while the requested data is read from or written
	to the underlying file. When opened asynchronously, any data written to the stream is
	immediately buffered and later written to the file.

	Whether reading from a file synchronously or asynchronously, the actual read methods are
	synchronous. In both cases they read from data that is currently "available." The difference
	is that when reading synchronously all of the data is available at all times, and when
	reading asynchronously data becomes available gradually as the data streams into a read
	buffer. Either way, the data that can be synchronously read at the current moment is
	represented by the bytesAvailable property.

	An application that is processing asynchronous input typically registers for progress events
	and consumes the data as it becomes available by calling read methods. Alternatively, an
	application can simply wait until all of the data is available by registering for the complete
	event and processing the entire data set when the complete event is dispatched.

		The position is defined as a Number (instead of uint) in order to support files larger than
		232 bytes in length. The value of this property is always a whole number less than 253. If
		you set this value to a number with a fractional component, the value is rounded down to
		the nearest integer.

		When reading a file asyncronously, if you set the position property, the application begins
		filling the read buffer with the data starting at the specified position, and the bytesAvailable
		property may be set to 0. Wait for a complete event before using a read method to read data;

		9,000 on a computer system with an 8KB (8192 byte) page size, the runtime reads ahead 2 blocks,
		or 16384 bytes at a time. The default value of this property is infinity: by default a file that
		is opened to read asynchronously reads as far as the end of the file.

		Reading data from the read buffer does not change the value of the readAhead property. When you
		read data from the buffer, new data is read in to refill the read buffer.

		The readAhead property has no effect on a file that is opened synchronously.

		As data is read in asynchronously, the FileStream object dispatches progress events. In the event
		handler method for the progress event, check to see that the required number of bytes is available
		(by checking the bytesAvailable property), and then read the data from the read buffer by using a

		Closing the application automatically closes all files associated with FileStream
