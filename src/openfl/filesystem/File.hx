/**
	A File object represents a path to a file or directory. This can be an existing file
	or directory, or it can be one that does not yet exist; for instance, it can represent
	the path to a file or directory that you plan to create.

	The File class has a number of properties and methods for getting information about the
	file system and for performing operations, such as copying files and directories.

	You can use File objects along with the FileStream class to read and write files.

	The File class extends the FileReference class. The FileReference class represents a
	pointer to a file, but the File class adds properties and methods that are not exposed
	in Flash or HTML5.

	The File class includes static properties that let you reference commonly used directory
	locations. These static properties include:

	* File.applicationStorageDirectory—a storage directory unique to each installed	application
	* File.applicationDirectory—the read-only directory where the application is installed
	(along with any installed assets)
	* File.desktopDirectory—the user's desktop directory
	* File.documentsDirectory—the user's documents directory
	* File.userDirectory—the user directory

	These properties have meaningful values on different operating systems. For example,
	Mac OS, Linux, and Windows each have different native paths to the user's desktop directory.
	However, the File.desktopDirectory property points to the correct desktop directory path
	on each of these platforms. To write applications that work well across platforms, use these
	properties as the basis for referencing other files used by the application. Then use the
	resolvePath() method to refine the path. For example, this code points to the preferences.xml
	file in the application storage directory:

	```hx
		var prefsFile:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory;
		prefsFile = prefsFile.resolvePath("preferences.xml");
	```

	If you use a literal native path in referencing a file, it will only work on one platform.
	For example, the following File object would only work on Windows:

	```hx
		new File("C:\Documents and Settings\joe\My Documents\test.txt")
	```

	The application storage directory is particularly useful. It gives an application-specific
	storage directory for the AIR application. It is defined by the File.applicationStorageDirectory
	property.

	@see [Related: FileStream](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/filesystem/FileStream.html)

	@event cancel    			Dispatched when a pending asynchronous operation is canceled.
	@event complete  			Dispatched when an asynchronous operation is complete.
	@event directoryListing 	Dispatched when a directory list is available as a result of a
	call to the getDirectoryListingAsync() method.
	@event ioError  			Dispatched when an error occurs during an asynchronous file operation.
	@event securityError  		Dispatched when an operation violates a security constraint.

		The folder containing the application's installed files.

		The url* property for this object uses the app URL scheme (not the file URL scheme). This
		means that the url string is specified starting with "app:" (not "file:"). Also, if you
		create a File object relative to the File.applicationDirectory directory (by using the
		resolvePath() method), the url property of the File object also uses the app URL scheme.
		*The url property is currently unsupported on all targets execpt AIR.

		Note: You cannot write to files or directories that have paths that use the app: URL scheme.
		Also, you cannot delete or create files or folders that have paths that use the app: URL
		scheme. Modifying content in the application directory is a bad practice, for security
		reasons, and is blocked by the operating system on some platforms. If you want to store
		application-specific data, consider using the application storage directory
		(File.applicationStorageDirectory). If you want any of the content in the application
		storage directory to have access to the application-privileged functionality (AIR APIs),
		you can expose that functionality by using a sandbox bridge.

		The applicationDirectory property provides a way to reference the application directory
		that works across platforms. If you set a File object to reference the application
		directory using the nativePath or url property, it will only work on the platform for
		which that path is valid.

		On Android, the nativePath property of a File object pointing to the application directory
		is an empty string. Use the url property to access application files.
