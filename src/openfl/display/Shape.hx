/**
	This class is used to create lightweight shapes using the ActionScript
	drawing application program interface(API). The Shape class includes a
	`graphics` property, which lets you access methods from the
	Graphics class.

	The Sprite class also includes a `graphics`property, and it
	includes other features not available to the Shape class. For example, a
	Sprite object is a display object container, whereas a Shape object is not
	(and cannot contain child display objects). For this reason, Shape objects
	consume less memory than Sprite objects that contain the same graphics.
	However, a Sprite object supports user input events, while a Shape object
	does not.
