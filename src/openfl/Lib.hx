	/**
		Opens or replaces a window in the application that contains the Flash Player
		container (usually a browser). In Adobe AIR, the function opens a URL in the
		default system web browser

		**Important Security Note**

		Developers often pass URL values to the `navigateToURL()` function that were
		obtained from external sources such as FlashVars. Attackers may try to manipulate
		these external sources to perform attacks such as cross-site scripting. Therefore,
		developers should validate all URLs before passing them to this function.

		Good data validation for URLs can mean different things depending on the usage of
		the URL within the overall application. The most common data validation techniques
		include validating that the URL is of the appropriate scheme. For instance,
		unintentionally allowing javascript: URLs may result in cross-site scripting.
		Validating that the URL is a within your domain can ensure that the SWF file can't
		be used as an open-redirector by people who conduct phishing attacks. For additional
		security, you may also choose to validate the path of the URL and to validate that
		the URL conforms to the RFC guidelines

		For example, the following code shows a simple example of performing data validation
		by denying any URL that does not begin with http:// or https:// and validating that
		the URL is within your domain name. This example may not be appropriate for all
		web applications and you should consider whether additional checks against the URL
		are necessary.

		```as3
		// AS3 Regular expression pattern match for URLs that start with http:// and https:// plus your domain name.
		function checkProtocol (flashVarURL:String):Boolean {
			// Get the domain name for the SWF if it is not known at compile time.
			// If the domain is known at compile time, then the following two lines can be replaced with a hard coded string.
			var my_lc:LocalConnection = new LocalConnection();
			var domainName:String = my_lc.domain;
			// Build the RegEx to test the URL.
			// This RegEx assumes that there is at least one "/" after the
			// domain. http://www.mysite.com will not match.
			var pattern:RegExp = new RegExp("^http[s]?\:\\/\\/([^\\/]+)\\/");
			var result:Object = pattern.exec(flashVarURL);
			if (result == null || result[1] != domainName || flashVarURL.length >= 4096) {
			return (false);
			}
			return (true);
		}
		```

		For local content running in a browser, calls to the `navigateToURL()` method that
		specify a "javascript:" pseudo-protocol (via a URLRequest object passed as the first
		parameter) are only permitted if the SWF file and the containing web page (if there
		is one) are in the local-trusted security sandbox. Some browsers do not support using
		the javascript protocol with the `navigateToURL()` method. Instead, consider using the
		`call()` method of the ExternalInterface API to invoke JavaScript methods within the
		enclosing HTML page.

		In Flash Player, and in non-application sandboxes in Adobe AIR, you cannot connect to
		commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of blocked ports, see "Restricting
		Networking APIs" in the ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide.

		In Flash Player 10 and later running in a browser, using this method programmatically
		to open a pop-up window may not be successful. Various browsers (and browser
		configurations) may block pop-up windows at any time; it is not possible to guarantee
		any pop-up window will appear. However, for the best chance of success, use this
		method to open a pop-up window only in code that executes as a direct result of a
		user action (for example, in an event handler for a mouse click or key-press event.)

		In Flash Player 10 and later, if you use a multipart Content-Type (for example
		"multipart/form-data") that contains an upload (indicated by a "filename" parameter
		in a "content-disposition" header within the POST body), the POST operation is subject
		to the security rules applied to uploads:

		* The POST operation must be performed in response to a user-initiated action, such
		as a mouse click or key press.
		* If the POST operation is cross-domain (the POST target is not on the same server
		as the SWF file that is sending the POST request), the target server must provide
		a URL policy file that permits cross-domain access.

		Also, for any multipart Content-Type, the syntax must be valid (according to the
		RFC2046 standards). If the syntax appears to be invalid, the POST operation is
		subject to the security rules applied to uploads.

		In AIR, on mobile platforms, the sms: and tel: URI schemes are supported. On
		Android, vipaccess:, connectpro:, and market: URI schemes are supported. The URL
		syntax is subject to the platform conventions. For example, on Android, the URI
		scheme must be lower case. When you navigate to a URL using one of these schemes,
		the runtime opens the URL in the default application for handling the scheme. Thus,
		navigating to tel:+5555555555 opens the phone dialer with the specified number
		already entered. A separate application or utility, such as a phone dialer must be
		available to process the URL.

		The following code shows how you can invoke the VIP Access and Connect Pro
		applications on Android:

		```as3
		//Invoke the VIP Access Application.
		navigateToURL(new URLRequest("vipaccess://com.verisign.mvip.main?action=securitycode"));

		//Invoke the Connect Pro Application.
		navigateToURL(new URLRequest("connectpro://"));
		```

		@param	request	A URLRequest object that specifies the URL to navigate to.
		For content running in Adobe AIR, when using the `navigateToURL()` function, the
		runtime treats a URLRequest that uses the POST method (one that has its method
		property set to `URLRequestMethod.POST`) as using the GET method.

		@param	window	The browser window or HTML frame in which to display the document
		indicated by the request parameter. You can enter the name of a specific window or
		use one of the following values:

		* `"_self"` specifies the current frame in the current window.
		* `"_blank"` specifies a new window.
		* `"_parent"` specifies the parent of the current frame.
		* `"_top"` specifies the top-level frame in the current window.

		If you do not specify a value for this parameter, a new empty window is created.
		In the stand-alone player, you can either specify a new ("_blank") window or a
		named window. The other values don't apply.

		**Note:** When code in a SWF file that is running in the local-with-filesystem
		sandbox calls the `navigateToURL()` function and specifies a custom window name
		for the window parameter, the window name is transfered into a random name. The
		name is in the form "_flashXXXXXXXX", where each X represents a random hexadecimal
		digit. Within the same session (until you close the containing browser window),
		if you call the function again and specify the same name for the window parameter,
		the same random string is used.

		@throws	IOError	The digest property of the request object is not null. You should
		only set the digest property of a URLRequest object for use calling the
		`URLLoader.load()` method when loading a SWZ file (an Adobe platform component).
		@throws	SecurityError	In Flash Player (and in non-application sandbox content in
		Adobe AIR), this error is thrown in the following situations:
		* Local untrusted SWF files may not communicate with the Internet. You can avoid
		this situation by reclassifying this SWF file as local-with-networking or trusted.
		* A navigate operation attempted to evaluate a scripting pseudo-URL, but the
		containing document (usually an HTML document in a browser) is from a sandbox to
		which you do not have access. You can avoid this situation by specifying
		`allowScriptAccess="always"` in the containing document.
		* You cannot navigate the special windows "_self", "_top", or "_parent" if your
		SWF file is contained by an HTML page that has set the allowScriptAccess to
		"none", or to "sameDomain" when the domains of the HTML file and the SWF file do
		not match.
		* You cannot navigate a window with a nondefault name from within a SWF file that
		is in the local-with-filesystem sandbox.
		* You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of blocked
		ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide.
		@throws	Error	If the method is not called in response to a user action, such as a
