		A Boolean value that determines which code page to use to interpret
		external text files. When the property is set to `false`,
		external text files are interpretted as Unicode.(These files must be
		encoded as Unicode when you save them.) When the property is set to
		`true`, external text files are interpretted using the
		traditional code page of the operating system running the application. The
		default value of `useCodePage` is `false`.

		Text that you load as an external file(using
		`Loader.load()`, the URLLoader class or URLStream) must have
		been saved as Unicode in order for the application to recognize it as
		Unicode. To encode external files as Unicode, save the files in an
		application that supports Unicode, such as Notepad on Windows.

		If you load external text files that are not Unicode-encoded, set
		`useCodePage` to `true`. Add the following as the
		first line of code of the file that is loading the data(for Flash
		Professional, add it to the first frame):
		`System.useCodePage = true;`

		When this code is present, the application interprets external text
		using the traditional code page of the operating system. For example, this
		is generally CP1252 for an English Windows operating system and Shift-JIS
		for a Japanese operating system.

		If you set `useCodePage` to `true`, Flash Player
		6 and later treat text as Flash Player 5 does.(Flash Player 5 treated all
		text as if it were in the traditional code page of the operating system
		running the player.)

		If you set `useCodePage` to `true`, remember that
		the traditional code page of the operating system running the application
		must include the characters used in your external text file in order to
		display your text. For example, if you load an external text file that
		contains Chinese characters, those characters cannot display on a system
		that uses the CP1252 code page because that code page does not include
		Chinese characters.

		To ensure that users on all platforms can view external text files used
		in your application, you should encode all external text files as Unicode
		and leave `useCodePage` set to `false`. This way,
		the application(Flash Player 6 and later, or AIR) interprets the text as
		Unicode.
