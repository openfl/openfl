/**
 * An object dispatches an ErrorEvent object when an error causes an
 * asynchronous operation to fail.
 *
 * <p>The ErrorEvent class defines only one type of <code>error</code> event:
 * <code>ErrorEvent.ERROR</code>. The ErrorEvent class also serves as the base
 * class for several other error event classes, including the AsyncErrorEvent,
 * IOErrorEvent, SecurityErrorEvent, SQLErrorEvent, and UncaughtErrorEvent
 * classes.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can check for <code>error</code> events that do not have any
 * listeners by registering a listener for the <code>uncaughtError</code>
 * (UncaughtErrorEvent.UNCAUGHT_ERROR) event.</p>
 *
 * <p>An uncaught error also causes an error dialog box displaying the error
 * event to appear when content is running in the debugger version of Flash
 * Player or the AIR Debug Launcher(ADL) application.</p>
