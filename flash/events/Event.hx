/**
 * The Event class is used as the base class for the creation of Event
 * objects, which are passed as parameters to event listeners when an event
 * occurs.
 *
 * <p>The properties of the Event class carry basic information about an
 * event, such as the event's type or whether the event's default behavior can
 * be canceled. For many events, such as the events represented by the Event
 * class constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events,
 * however, may require more detailed information. Events associated with a
 * mouse click, for example, need to include additional information about the
 * location of the click event and whether any keys were pressed during the
 * click event. You can pass such additional information to event listeners by
 * extending the Event class, which is what the MouseEvent class does.
 * ActionScript 3.0 API defines several Event subclasses for common events
 * that require additional information. Events associated with each of the
 * Event subclasses are described in the documentation for each class.</p>
 *
 * <p>The methods of the Event class can be used in event listener functions
 * to affect the behavior of the event object. Some events have an associated
 * default behavior. For example, the <code>doubleClick</code> event has an
 * associated default behavior that highlights the word under the mouse
 * pointer at the time of the event. Your event listener can cancel this
 * behavior by calling the <code>preventDefault()</code> method. You can also
 * make the current event listener the last one to process an event by calling
 * the <code>stopPropagation()</code> or
 * <code>stopImmediatePropagation()</code> method.</p>
