	 *
	 * <p>Text that you load as an external file(using
	 * <code>Loader.load()</code>, the URLLoader class or URLStream) must have
	 * been saved as Unicode in order for the application to recognize it as
	 * Unicode. To encode external files as Unicode, save the files in an
	 * application that supports Unicode, such as Notepad on Windows.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>If you load external text files that are not Unicode-encoded, set
	 * <code>useCodePage</code> to <code>true</code>. Add the following as the
	 * first line of code of the file that is loading the data(for Flash

	 * using the traditional code page of the operating system. For example, this
	 * is generally CP1252 for an English Windows operating system and Shift-JIS
	 * for a Japanese operating system.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>If you set <code>useCodePage</code> to <code>true</code>, Flash Player
	 * 6 and later treat text as Flash Player 5 does.(Flash Player 5 treated all
	 * text as if it were in the traditional code page of the operating system
	 * running the player.)</p>
	 *
	 * <p>If you set <code>useCodePage</code> to <code>true</code>, remember that
	 * the traditional code page of the operating system running the application
	 * must include the characters used in your external text file in order to
	 * display your text. For example, if you load an external text file that
	 * contains Chinese characters, those characters cannot display on a system
	 * that uses the CP1252 code page because that code page does not include
	 * Chinese characters.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>To ensure that users on all platforms can view external text files used
	 * in your application, you should encode all external text files as Unicode
	 * and leave <code>useCodePage</code> set to <code>false</code>. This way,
	 * the application(Flash Player 6 and later, or AIR) interprets the text as
