/**
 * The Transform class provides access to color adjustment properties and two-
 * or three-dimensional transformation objects that can be applied to a
 * display object. During the transformation, the color or the orientation and
 * position of a display object is adjusted(offset) from the current values
 * or coordinates to new values or coordinates. The Transform class also
 * collects data about color and two-dimensional matrix transformations that
 * are applied to a display object and all of its parent objects. You can
 * access these combined transformations through the
 * <code>concatenatedColorTransform</code> and <code>concatenatedMatrix</code>
 * properties.
 *
 * <p>To apply color transformations: create a ColorTransform object, set the
 * color adjustments using the object's methods and properties, and then
 * assign the <code>colorTransformation</code> property of the
 * <code>transform</code> property of the display object to the new
 * ColorTransformation object.</p>
 *
 * <p>To apply two-dimensional transformations: create a Matrix object, set
 * the matrix's two-dimensional transformation, and then assign the
 * <code>transform.matrix</code> property of the display object to the new
 * Matrix object.</p>
 *
 * <p>To apply three-dimensional transformations: start with a
 * three-dimensional display object. A three-dimensional display object has a
 * <code>z</code> property value other than zero. You do not need to create
 * the Matrix3D object. For all three-dimensional objects, a Matrix3D object
 * is created automatically when you assign a <code>z</code> value to a
 * display object. You can access the display object's Matrix3D object through
 * the display object's <code>transform</code> property. Using the methods of
 * the Matrix3D class, you can add to or modify the existing transformation
 * settings. Also, you can create a custom Matrix3D object, set the custom
 * Matrix3D object's transformation elements, and then assign the new Matrix3D
 * object to the display object using the <code>transform.matrix</code>
 * property.</p>
 *
 * <p>To modify a perspective projection of the stage or root object: use the
 * <code>transform.matrix</code> property of the root display object to gain
 * access to the PerspectiveProjection object. Or, apply different perspective
 * projection properties to a display object by setting the perspective
 * projection properties of the display object's parent. The child display
 * object inherits the new properties. Specifically, create a
 * PerspectiveProjection object and set its properties, then assign the
 * PerspectiveProjection object to the <code>perspectiveProjection</code>
 * property of the parent display object's <code>transform</code> property.
 * The specified projection transformation then applies to all the display
 * object's three-dimensional children.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since both PerspectiveProjection and Matrix3D objects perform
 * perspective transformations, do not assign both to a display object at the
 * same time. Use the PerspectiveProjection object for focal length and
 * projection center changes. For more control over the perspective
 * transformation, create a perspective projection Matrix3D object.</p>
