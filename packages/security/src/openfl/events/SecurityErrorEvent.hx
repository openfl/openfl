/**
	An object dispatches a SecurityErrorEvent object to report the occurrence
	of a security error. Security errors reported through this class are
	generally from asynchronous operations, such as loading data, in which
	security violations may not manifest immediately. Your event listener can
	access the object's `text` property to determine what operation
	was attempted and any URLs that were involved. If there are no event
	listeners, the debugger version of Flash Player or the AIR Debug Launcher
	(ADL) application automatically displays an error message that contains the
	contents of the `text` property. There is one type of security
	error event: `SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR`.

	Security error events are the final events dispatched for any target
	object. This means that any other events, including generic error events,
	are not dispatched for a target object that experiences a security
	error.
