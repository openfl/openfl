/**
	The Socket class enables code to establish Transport Control Protocol
	(TCP) socket connections for sending and receiving binary data.
	The Socket class is useful for working with servers that use binary
	protocols.

	To use the methods of the Socket class, first use the constructor, `new
	Socket`, to create a Socket object.

	A socket transmits and receives data asynchronously.

	On some operating systems, flush() is called automatically between
	execution frames, but on other operating systems, such as Windows, the
	data is never sent unless you call `flush()` explicitly. To ensure your
	application behaves reliably across all operating systems, it is a good
	practice to call the `flush()` method after writing each message (or
	related group of data) to the socket.

	In Adobe AIR, Socket objects are also created when a listening
	ServerSocket receives a connection from an external process. The Socket
	representing the connection is dispatched in a ServerSocketConnectEvent.
	Your application is responsible for maintaining a reference to this Socket
	object. If you don't, the Socket object is eligible for garbage collection
	and may be destroyed by the runtime without warning.

	SWF content running in the local-with-filesystem security sandbox cannot
	use sockets.

	_Socket policy files_ on the target host specify the hosts from which SWF
	files can make socket connections, and the ports to which those
	connections can be made. The security requirements with regard to socket
	policy files have become more stringent in the last several releases of
	Flash Player. In all versions of Flash Player, Adobe recommends the use of
	a socket policy file; in some circumstances, a socket policy file is
	required. Therefore, if you are using Socket objects, make sure that the
	target host provides a socket policy file if necessary.

	The following list summarizes the requirements for socket policy files in
	different versions of Flash Player:

	*  In Flash Player 9.0.124.0 and later, a socket policy file is required
	for any socket connection. That is, a socket policy file on the target
	host is required no matter what port you are connecting to, and is
	required even if you are connecting to a port on the same host that is
	serving the SWF file.
	*  In Flash Player versions 9.0.115.0 and earlier, if you want to connect
	to a port number below 1024, or if you want to connect to a host other
	than the one serving the SWF file, a socket policy file on the target host
	is required.
	*  In Flash Player 9.0.115.0, even if a socket policy file isn't required,
	a warning is displayed when using the Flash Debug Player if the target
	host doesn't serve a socket policy file.
	* In AIR, a socket policy file is not required for content running in the
	application security sandbox. Socket policy files are required for any
	socket connection established by content running outside the AIR
	application security sandbox.

	For more information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer
	Center Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en"
	scope="external">Security</a>

	@event close         Dispatched when the server closes the socket
						 connection.
						 The `close` event is dispatched only when the server
						 closes the connection; it is not dispatched when you
						 call the `Socket.close()` method.
	@event connect       Dispatched when a network connection has been
						 established.
	@event ioError       Dispatched when an input/output error occurs that
						 causes a send or load operation to fail.
	@event securityError Dispatched if a call to `Socket.connect()` attempts
						 to connect to a server prohibited by the caller's
						 security sandbox or to a port lower than 1024 and no
						 socket policy file exists to permit such a
						 connection.
						 **Note:** In an AIR application, content running in
						 the application security sandbox is permitted to
						 connect to any server and port number without a
						 socket policy file.
	@event socketData    Dispatched when a socket has received data.
						 The data received by the socket remains in the socket
						 until it is read. You do not have to read all the
						 available data during the handler for this event.

						 Events of type `socketData` do not use the
						 `ProgressEvent.bytesTotal` property.
