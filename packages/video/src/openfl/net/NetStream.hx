/**
	The NetStream class opens a one-way streaming channel over a
	NetConnection.
	Use the NetStream class to do the following:

	* Call `NetStream.play()` to play a media file from a local disk, a web
	server, or Flash Media Server.
	* Call `NetStream.publish()` to publish a video, audio, and data stream to
	Flash Media Server.
	* Call `NetStream.send()` to send data messages to all subscribed clients.
	* Call `NetStream.send()` to add metadata to a live stream.
	* Call `NetStream.appendBytes()` to pass ByteArray data into the
	NetStream.

	**Note:**You cannot play and publish a stream over the same NetStream
	object.

	Adobe AIR and Flash Player 9.0.115.0 and later versions support files
	derived from the standard MPEG-4 container format. These files include
	F4V, MP4, M4A, MOV, MP4V, 3GP, and 3G2 if they contain H.264 video, HEAAC
	v2 encoded audio, or both. H.264 delivers higher quality video at lower
	bit rates when compared to the same encoding profile in Sorenson or On2.
	AAC is a standard audio format defined in the MPEG-4 video standard.
	HE-AAC v2 is an extension of AAC that uses Spectral Band Replication (SBR)
	and Parametric Stereo (PS) techniques to increase coding efficiency at low
	bit rates.

	For information about supported codecs and file formats, see the

	**Receiving data from a Flash Media Server stream, progressive F4V file,
	or progressive FLV file**

	Flash Media Server, F4V files, and FLV files can send event objects
	containing data at specific data points during streaming or playback. You
	can handle data from a stream or FLV file during playback in two ways:

	*  Associate a client property with an event handler to receive the data
	object. Use the `NetStream.client` property to assign an object to call
	specific data handling functions. The object assigned to the
	`NetStream.client` property can listen for the following data points:
	`onCuePoint()`, `onImageData()`, `onMetaData()`, `onPlayStatus()`,
	`onSeekPoint()`, `onTextData()`, and `onXMPData()`. Write procedures
	within those functions to handle the data object returned from the stream
	during playback. See the `NetStream.client` property for more information.

	*  Associate a client property with a subclass of the NetStream class,
	then write an event handler to receive the data object. NetStream is a
	sealed class, which means that properties or methods cannot be added to a
	NetStream object at runtime. However, you can create a subclass of
	NetStream and define your event handler in the subclass. You can also make
	the subclass dynamic and add the event handler to an instance of the
	subclass.

	Wait to receive a `NetGroup.Neighbor.Connect` event before you use the
	object replication, direct routing, or posting APIs.

	**Note:** To send data through an audio file, like an mp3 file, use the
	Sound class to associate the audio file with a Sound object. Then, use the
	`Sound.id3` property to read metadata from the sound file.

	@event asyncError       Dispatched when an exception is thrown
							asynchronously × that is, from native
							asynchronous code. This event is dispatched when a
							server calls a method on the client that is not
							defined.
	@event drmAuthenticate  Dispatched when a NetStream object tries to play a
							digital rights management (DRM) encrypted content
							that requires a user credential for authentication
							before playing.
							Use the ` setDRMAuthenticationCredentials()`
							method of the NetStream object to authenticate the
							user. If user authentication failed, the
							application retries authentication and dispatches
							a new DRMAuthenticateEvent event for the NetStream
							object.
	@event drmError         Dispatched when a NetStream object, trying to play
							a digital rights management (DRM) encrypted file,
							encounters a DRM-related error. For example, a
							DRMErrorEvent object is dispatched when the user
							authorization fails. This may be because the user
							has not purchased the rights to view the content
							or because the content provider does not support
							the viewing application.
	@event drmStatus        Dispatched when the digital rights management
							(DRM) encrypted content begins playing (when the
							user is authenticated and authorized to play the
							content).
							DRMStatusEvent object contains information related
							to the voucher, such as whether the content is
							available offline or when the voucher expires and
							users can no longer view the content.
	@event ioError          Dispatched when an input or output error occurs
							that causes a network operation to fail.
	@event mediaTypeData    Dispatched when playing video content and certain
							type of messages are processed.
							A NetDataEvent is dispatched for the following
							messages:

							* onCuePoint
							* onImageData
							* onMetaData
							* onPlayStatus (for code NetStream.Play.Complete)
							* onTextData
							* onXMPData

							**Note:** This event is not dispatched by content
							running in Flash Player in the browser on Android
							or Blackberry Tablet OS or by content running in
							AIR on iOS.
	@event netStatus        Dispatched when a NetStream object is reporting
							its status or error condition. The `netStatus`
							event contains an `info` property, which is an
							information object that contains specific
							information about the event, such as if a
							connection attempt succeeded or failed.
	@event onCuePoint       Establishes a listener to respond when an embedded
							cue point is reached while playing a video file.
							You can use the listener to trigger actions in
							your code when the video reaches a specific cue
							point, which lets you synchronize other actions in
							your application with video playback events. For
							information about video file formats supported by
							Flash Media Server, see the <a
							href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en"
							scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en</a>.

							`onCuePoint` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. IThe property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description. You cannot use the
							`addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process
							`onCuePoint` as an event. Define a callback
							function and attach it to one of the following
							objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define
							your event handler in the subclass. You can also
							make the subclass dynamic and add the event
							handler function to an instance of the subclass.

							The associated event listener is triggered after a
							call to the `NetStream.play()` method, but before
							the video playhead has advanced.

							You can embed the following types of cue points in
							a video file:

							* A navigation cue point specifies a keyframe
							within the video file and the cue point's `time`
							property corresponds to that exact keyframe.
							Navigation cue points are often used as bookmarks
							or entry points to let users navigate through the
							video file.
							* An event cue point specifies a time. The time
							may or may not correspond to a specific keyframe.
							An event cue point usually represents a time in
							the video when something happens that could be
							used to trigger other application events.

							The `onCuePoint` event object has the following
							properties:

							| Property | Description |
							| --- | --- |
							| `name` | The name given to the cue point when it was embedded in the video file. |
							|`parameters` | An associative array of name and value pair strings specified for this cue point. Any valid string can be used for the parameter name or value. |
							|`time` | The time in seconds at which the cue point occurred in the video file during playback. |
							|`type` | The type of cue point that was reached, either navigation or event. |

							You can define cue points in a video file when you
							first encode the file, or when you import a video
							clip in the Flash authoring tool by using the
							Video Import wizard.

							The `onMetaData` event also retrieves information
							about the cue points in a video file. However the
							`onMetaData` event gets information about all of
							the cue points before the video begins playing.
							The `onCuePoint` event receives information about
							a single cue point at the time specified for that
							cue point during playback.

							Generally, to have your code respond to a specific
							cue point at the time it occurs, use the
							`onCuePoint` event to trigger some action in your
							code.

							You can use the list of cue points provided to the
							`onMetaData` event to let the user start playing
							the video at predefined points along the video
							stream. Pass the value of the cue point's `time`
							property to the `NetStream.seek()` method to play
							the video from that cue point.
	@event onDRMContentData Establishes a listener to respond when AIR
							extracts DRM content metadata embedded in a media
							file.
							A DRMContentData object contains the information
							needed to obtain a voucher required to play a
							DRM-protected media file. Use the DRMManager class
							to download the voucher with this information.

							`onDRMContentData` is a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. This property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event when preloading embedded data from a
							local media file. For more information, see the
							NetStream class description. You cannot use the
							`addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process
							`onDRMContentData` as an event. Rather, you must
							define a single callback function and attach it
							directly to one of the following objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. However, you can create a subclass of
							NetStream and define your event handler in the
							subclass or make the subclass dynamic and add the
							event handler function to an instance of the
							subclass.
	@event onImageData      Establishes a listener to respond when Flash
							Player receives image data as a byte array
							embedded in a media file that is playing. The
							image data can produce either JPEG, PNG, or GIF
							content. Use the
							`openfl.display.Loader.loadBytes()` method to load
							the byte array into a display object.
							`onImageData` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description. You cannot use the
							`addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process
							`onImageData` as an event. Define a single
							callback function and attach it to one of the
							following objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define
							your event handler in the subclass. You can also
							make the subclass dynamic and add the event
							handler function to an instance of the subclass.

							The associated event listener is triggered after a
							call to the `NetStream.play()` method, but before
							the video playhead has advanced.

							The onImageData event object contains the image
							data as a byte array sent through an AMF0 data
							channel.
	@event onMetaData       Establishes a listener to respond when Flash
							Player receives descriptive information embedded
							in the video being played. For information about
							video file formats supported by Flash Media
							Server, see the <a
							href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en"
							scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en</a>.

							`onMetaData` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description and the `NetStream.client` property.
							You cannot use the `addEventListener()` method, or
							any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for
							or process `onMetaData` as an event. Define a
							single callback function and attach it to one of
							the following objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. You can create a subclass of NetStream
							and define your event handler in the subclass. You
							can also make the subclass dynamic and add the
							event handler function to an instance of the
							subclass.

							The Flash Video Exporter utility (version 1.1 or
							later) embeds a video's duration, creation date,
							data rates, and other information into the video
							file itself. Different video encoders embed
							different sets of meta data.

							The associated event listener is triggered after a
							call to the `NetStream.play()` method, but before
							the video playhead has advanced.

							In many cases, the duration value embedded in
							stream metadata approximates the actual duration
							but is not exact. In other words, it does not
							always match the value of the `NetStream.time`
							property when the playhead is at the end of the
							video stream.

							The event object passed to the onMetaData event
							handler contains one property for each piece of
							data.
	@event onPlayStatus     Establishes a listener to respond when a NetStream
							object has completely played a stream. The
							associated event object provides information in
							addition to what's returned by the `netStatus`
							event. You can use this property to trigger
							actions in your code when a NetStream object has
							switched from one stream to another stream in a
							playlist (as indicated by the information object
							`NetStream.Play.Switch`) or when a NetStream
							object has played to the end (as indicated by the
							information object `NetStream.Play.Complete`).
							`onPlayStaus` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description. You cannot use the
							`addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process
							`onPlayStatus` as an event. Define a callback
							function and attach it to one of the following
							objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define
							your event handler in the subclass. You can also
							make the subclass dynamic and add the event
							handler function to an instance of the subclass.

							This event can return an information object with
							the following properties:

							| Code property | Level property | Meaning |
							| --- | --- | --- |
							| `NetStream.Play.Switch` | `"status"` | The subscriber is switching from one stream to another in a playlist. |
							| `NetStream.Play.Complete` | `"status"` | Playback has completed. |
							| `NetStream.Play.TransitionComplete` | `"status"` | The subscriber is switching to a new stream as a result of stream bit-rate switching |
	@event onSeekPoint      Called synchronously from `appendBytes()` when the
							append bytes parser encounters a point that it
							believes is a seekable point (for example, a video
							key frame). Use this event to construct a seek
							point table. The `byteCount` corresponds to the
							`byteCount` at the first byte of the parseable
							message for that seek point, and is reset to zero
							as described above. To seek, at the event
							`NetStream.Seek.Notify`, find the bytes that start
							at a seekable point and call `appendBytes(bytes)`.
							If the `bytes` argument is a `ByteArray`
							consisting of bytes starting at the seekable
							point, the video plays at that seek point.
							**Note:** Calls to `appendBytes()` from within
							this callback are ignored.

							The `onSeekPoint` property is a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to data
							coming into the `appendBytes()` method. For more
							information, see the NetStream class description
							and the `NetStream.client` property. You cannot
							use the `addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for or process
							`onSeekPoint` as an event. To use `onSeekPoint`,
							define a callback function and attach it to one of
							the following objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. However, you can create a subclass of
							NetStream and define your event handler in the
							subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic
							and add the event handler function to an instance
							of the subclass.
	@event onTextData       Establishes a listener to respond when Flash
							Player receives text data embedded in a media file
							that is playing. The text data is in UTF-8 format
							and can contain information about formatting based
							on the 3GP timed text specification.
							`onTextData` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description. You cannot use the
							`addEventListener()` method, or any other
							EventDispatcher methods, to listen for, or process
							`onTextData` as an event. Define a callback
							function and attach it to one of the following
							objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. Create a subclass of NetStream and define
							your event handler in the subclass. You can also
							make the subclass dynamic and add the event
							handler function to an instance of the subclass.

							The associated event listener is triggered after a
							call to the `NetStream.play()` method, but before
							the video playhead has advanced.

							The onTextData event object contains one property
							for each piece of text data.
	@event onXMPData        Establishes a listener to respond when Flash
							Player receives information specific to Adobe
							Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) embedded in the
							video being played. For information about video
							file formats supported by Flash Media Server, see
							the <a
							href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en"
							scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_fileformats_en</a>.

							`onXMPData` is actually a property of the
							`NetStream.client` object. The property is listed
							in the Events section because it responds to a
							data event, either when streaming media using
							Flash Media Server or during FLV file playback.
							For more information, see the NetStream class
							description and the `NetStream.client` property.
							You cannot use the `addEventListener()` method, or
							any other EventDispatcher methods, to listen for
							or process `onMetaData` as an event. Define a
							callback function and attach it to one of the
							following objects:

							* The object that the `client` property of a
							NetStream instance references.
							* An instance of a NetStream subclass. NetStream
							is a sealed class, which means that properties or
							methods cannot be added to a NetStream object at
							runtime. However, you can create a subclass of
							NetStream and define your event handler in the
							subclass. You can also make the subclass dynamic
							and add the event handler function to an instance
							of the subclass.

							The associated event listener is triggered after a
							call to the `NetStream.play()` method, but before
							the video playhead has advanced.

							The object passed to the `onXMPData()` event
							handling function has one `data` property, which
							is a string. The string is generated from a
							top-level UUID box. (The 128-bit UUID of the top
							level box is
							`BE7ACFCB-97A9-42E8-9C71-999491E3AFAC`.) This
							top-level UUID box contains exactly one XML
							document represented as a null-terminated UTF-8
							string.
	@event status           Dispatched when the application attempts to play
							content encrypted with digital rights management
							(DRM), by invoking the `NetStream.play()` method.
							The value of the status code property will be
							`"DRM.encryptedFLV"`.

		Specifies how long to buffer messages before starting to display the

		The default value is 0.1 (one-tenth of a second). To determine the
		number of seconds currently in the buffer, use the `bufferLength`
		property.

		To play a server-side playlist, set `bufferTime` to at least 1 second.
		If you experience playback issues, increase the length of
		`bufferTime`.

		**Recorded content** To avoid distortion when streaming pre-recorded
		(not live) content, do not set the value of `Netstream.bufferTime` to
		0. By default, the application uses an input buffer for pre-recorded
		content that queues the media data and plays the media properly. For
		pre-recorded content, use the default setting or increase the buffer
		time.

		**Live content** When streaming live content, set the `bufferTime`
		property to 0.

		Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears
		the buffer when `NetStream.pause()` is called. Before Flash Player
		9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for the buffer to fill up before
		resuming playback, which often caused a delay.

		For a single pause, the `NetStream.bufferLength` property has a limit
		of either 60 seconds or twice the value of `NetStream.bufferTime`,
		whichever value is higher. For example, if `bufferTime` is 20 seconds,
		Flash Player buffers until `NetStream.bufferLength` is the higher
		value of either 20*2 (40), or 60. In this case it buffers until
		`bufferLength` is 60. If `bufferTime` is 40 seconds, Flash Player
		buffers until `bufferLength` is the higher value of 40*2 (80), or 60.
		In this case it buffers until `bufferLength` is 80 seconds.

		The `bufferLength` property also has an absolute limit. If any call to
		`pause()` causes `bufferLength` to increase more than 600 seconds or
		the value of `bufferTime`* 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player
		flushes the buffer and resets `bufferLength` to 0. For example, if
		`bufferTime` is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if
		`bufferLength` reaches 600 seconds; if `bufferTime` is 360 seconds,
		Flash Player flushes the buffer if `bufferLength` reaches 720 seconds.

		**Tip**: You can use `NetStream.pause()` in code to buffer data while
		viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when
		the main video starts.

		For more information about the new pause behavior, see <a
		href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en"
		scope="external">http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_smartpause_en</a>.

		**Flash Media Server**. The buffer behavior depends on whether the
		buffer time is set on a publishing stream or a subscribing stream. For
		a publishing stream, `bufferTime` specifies how long the outgoing
		buffer can grow before the application starts dropping frames. On a
		high-speed connection, buffer time is not a concern; data is sent
		almost as quickly as the application can buffer it. On a slow
		connection, however, there can be a significant difference between how
		fast the application buffers the data and how fast it is sent to the
		client.

		For a subscribing stream, `bufferTime` specifies how long to buffer
		incoming data before starting to display the stream.

		When a recorded stream is played, if `bufferTime` is 0, Flash sets it
		to a small value (approximately 10 milliseconds). If live streams are
		later played (for example, from a playlist), this buffer time
		persists. That is, `bufferTime` remains nonzero for the stream.

		When `bufferTimeMax > 0` and `bufferLength >= bufferTimeMax`, audio

		Depending on how much playback is lagging (the difference between

		This property is ignored when you are using RTMP.
		Set this property to `true` to call `BitmapData.draw()` on a video
		file loaded from a domain outside that of the calling SWF. The
		`BitmapData.draw()` method provides pixel-level access to the video.
		If you call `BitmapData.draw()` without setting the `checkPolicyFile`
		property to `true` at loading time, you can get a `SecurityError`
		exception because the required policy file was not downloaded.

		Do not set this property to true unless you want pixel-level access to
		the video you are loading. Checking for a policy file consumes network
		bandwidth and can delay the start of your download.

		When you call the `NetStream.play()` method with `checkPolicyFile` set
		to `true`, Flash Player or the AIR runtime must either successfully
		download a relevant cross-domain policy file or determine that no such
		policy file exists before it begins downloading. To verify the
		existence of a policy file, Flash Player or the AIR runtime performs
		the following actions, in this order:

		1. The application considers policy files that have already been
		downloaded.
		2. The application tries to download any pending policy files specified
		in calls to the `Security.loadPolicyFile()` method.
		3. The application tries to download a policy file from the default
		location that corresponds to the URL you passed to `NetStream.play()`,
		which is `/crossdomain.xml` on the same server as that URL.

		In all cases, Flash Player or Adobe AIR requires that an appropriate
		policy file exist on the video's server, that it provide access to the
		object at the URL you passed to `play()` based on the policy file's
		location, and that it allow the domain of the calling code's file to
		access the video, through one or more `<allow-access-from>` tags.

		If you set `checkPolicyFile` to `true`, the application waits until
		the policy file is verified before downloading the video. Wait to
		perform any pixel-level operations on the video data, such as calling
		`BitmapData.draw()`, until you receive `onMetaData` or `NetStatus`
		events from your NetStream object.

		If you set `checkPolicyFile` to `true` but no relevant policy file is
		found, you won't receive an error until you perform an operation that
		requires a policy file, and then the application throws a
		SecurityError exception.

		Be careful with `checkPolicyFile` if you are downloading a file from a
		URL that uses server-side HTTP redirects. The application tries to
		retrieve policy files that correspond to the initial URL that you
		specify in `NetStream.play()`. If the final file comes from a
		different URL because of HTTP redirects, the initially downloaded
		policy files might not be applicable to the file's final URL, which is
		the URL that matters in security decisions.

		For more information on policy files, see "Website controls (policy
		files)" in the _ActionScript 3.0 Developer's Guide_ and the Flash
		Player Developer Center Topic: <a

		another object, callback methods are invoked on that other object. The
		`NetStream.client ` object can call the following functions and
		receive an associated data object: `onCuePoint()`, `onImageData()`,
		`onMetaData()`, `onPlayStatus()`, `onSeekPoint()`, `onTextData()`, and
		`onXMPData()`.
		**To associate the `client` property with an event handler:**

		1. Create an object and assign it to the `client` property of the
		NetStream object:
		```as3
		var customClient = new Object();
		my_netstream.client = customClient;
		```
		2. Assign a handler function for the desired data event as a property
		of the client object:
		```haxe
		customClient.onImageData = onImageDataHandler;
		```
		3. Write the handler function to receive the data event object, such
		as:
		```as3
		public function onImageDataHandler(imageData:Object):void {
			trace("imageData length: " + imageData.data.length);
		}
		```

		When data is passed through the stream or during playback, the data
		event object (in this case the `imageData` object) is populated with
		the data. See the `onImageData` description, which includes a full
		example of an object assigned to the `client` property.

		**To associate the `client` property with a subclass:**

		1. Create a subclass with a handler function to receive the data event
		object:
		```as3
		class CustomClient {
			public function onMetaData(info:Object):void {
				trace("metadata: duration=" + info.duration + " framerate=" + info.framerate);
			}
		```
		2. Assign an instance of the subclass to the `client` property of the
		NetStream object:
		```as3
		my_netstream.client = new CustomClient();
		```

		When data is passed through the stream or during playback, the data
		event object (in this case the `info` object) is populated with the

		Starts capturing video from a camera, or stops capturing if
		`theCamera` is set to `null`. This method is available only to the
		publisher of the specified stream.
		This method is intended for use with Flash Media Server; for more
		information, see the class description.

		After attaching the video source, you must call `NetStream.publish()`
		to begin transmitting. Subscribers who want to display the video must
		call the `NetStream.play()` and `Video.attachCamera()` methods to
		display the video on the stage.

		You can use `snapshotMilliseconds` to send a single snapshot (by
		providing a value of 0) or a series of snapshots × in effect,
		time-lapse footage × by providing a positive number that adds a
		trailer of the specified number of milliseconds to the video feed. The
		trailer extends the display time of the video message. By repeatedly
		calling `attachCamera()` with a positive value for
		`snapshotMilliseconds`, the sequence of alternating snapshots and
		trailers creates time-lapse footage. For example, you could capture
		one frame per day and append it to a video file. When a subscriber
		plays the file, each frame remains onscreen for the specified number
		of milliseconds and then the next frame is displayed.

		The purpose of the `snapshotMilliseconds` parameter is different from
		the `fps` parameter you can set with `Camera.setMode()`. When you
		specify `snapshotMilliseconds`, you control how much time elapses
		between recorded frames. When you specify `fps` using
		`Camera.setMode()`, you are controlling how much time elapses during
		recording and playback.

		For example, suppose you want to take a snapshot every 5 minutes for a
		total of 100 snapshots. You can do this in two ways:

		* You can issue a `NetStream.attachCamera(myCamera, 500)` command 100
		times, once every 5 minutes. This takes 500 minutes to record, but the
		resulting file will play back in 50 seconds (100 frames with 500
		milliseconds between frames).
		* You can issue a `Camera.setMode()` command with an `fps` value of
		1/300 (one per 300 seconds, or one every 5 minutes), and then issue a
		`NetStream.attachCamera(source)` command, letting the camera capture
		continuously for 500 minutes. The resulting file will play back in 500
		minutes × the same length of time that it took to record × with
		each frame being displayed for 5 minutes.

		Both techniques capture the same 500 frames, and both approaches are
		useful; the approach to use depends primarily on your playback
		requirements. For example, in the second case, you could be recording
		audio the entire time. Also, both files would be approximately the
		same size.

		@param theCamera The source of the video transmission. Valid values
						 are a Camera object (which starts capturing video)
						 and `null`. If you pass `null`, the application stops
						 capturing video, and any additional parameters you
						 send are ignored.

		Pauses playback of a video stream. Calling this method does nothing if
		the video is already paused. To resume play after pausing a video,
		call `resume()`. To toggle between pause and play (first pausing the
		video, then resuming), call `togglePause()`.
		Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player no longer clears
		the buffer when `NetStream.pause()` is called. This behavior is called
		"smart pause". Before Flash Player 9.0.115.0, Flash Player waited for
		the buffer to fill up before resuming playback, which often caused a
		delay.

		**Note:** For backwards compatibility, the `"NetStream.Buffer.Flush"`
		event (see the `NetStatusEvent.info` property) still fires, although
		the server does not flush the buffer.

		For a single pause, the `NetStream.bufferLength` property has a limit
		of either 60 seconds or twice the value of `NetStream.bufferTime`,
		whichever value is higher. For example, if `bufferTime` is 20 seconds,
		Flash Player buffers until `NetStream.bufferLength` is the higher
		value of either 20~~2 (40), or 60, so in this case it buffers until
		`bufferLength` is 60. If `bufferTime` is 40 seconds, Flash Player
		buffers until `bufferLength` is the higher value of 40~~2 (80), or 60,
		so in this case it buffers until `bufferLength` is 80 seconds.

		The `bufferLength` property also has an absolute limit. If any call to
		`pause()` causes `bufferLength` to increase more than 600 seconds or
		the value of `bufferTime` ~~ 2, whichever is higher, Flash Player
		flushes the buffer and resets `bufferLength` to 0. For example, if
		`bufferTime` is 120 seconds, Flash Player flushes the buffer if
		`bufferLength` reaches 600 seconds; if `bufferTime` is 360 seconds,
		Flash Player flushes the buffer if `bufferLength` reaches 720 seconds.

		**Tip**: You can use `NetStream.pause()` in code to buffer data while
		viewers are watching a commercial, for example, and then unpause when
		the main video starts.

		**Workflow for playing a file or live stream**

		1. Create a NetConnection object and call `NetConnection.connect()`.
		To play a file from a local directory or web server, pass null.

		To play a recorded file or live stream from Flash Media Server, pass
		the URI of a Flash Media Server application.
		2. Call `NetConnection.addEventListener(NetStatusEvent.NET_STATUS,
		netStatusHandler)` to listen for NetStatusEvent events.
		3. On `"NetConnection.Connect.Success"`, create a NetStream object and
		pass the NetConnection object to the constructor.
		4. Create a Video object and call `Video.attachNetStream()` and pass
		the NetStream object.
		5. Call `NetStream.play()`.
		To play a live stream, pass the stream name passed to the
		`NetStream.publish()` method.

		To play a recorded file, pass the file name.
		6. Call `addChild()` and pass the Video object to display the video.

		**Note:**To see sample code, scroll to the example at the bottom of
		this page.

		**Enable Data Generation Mode**

		Call `play(null)` to enable "Data Generation Mode". In this mode, call
		the `appendBytes()` method to deliver data to the NetStream. Use Data
		Generation Mode to stream content over HTTP from the Adobe HTTP
		Dynamic Streaming Origin Module on an Apache HTTP Server. HTTP Dynamic
		Streaming lets clients seek quickly to any point in a file. The Open
		Source Media Framework (OSMF) supports HTTP Dynamic Streaming for vod
		and live streams. For examples of how to use NetStream Data Generation
		Mode, download the <a href="http://www.opensourcemediaframework.com"
		scope="external">OSMF</a> source. For more information about HTTP
		Dynamic Streaming, see <a
		href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_http_en" scope="external">HTTP
		Dynamic Streaming</a>.

		When you use this method without Flash Media Server, there are
		security considerations. A file in the local-trusted or
		local-with-networking sandbox can load and play a video file from the
		remote sandbox, but cannot access the remote file's data without
		explicit permission in the form of a URL policy file. Also, you can
		prevent a SWF file running in Flash Player from using this method by
		setting the `allowNetworking` parameter of the the `object` and
		`embed` tags in the HTML page that contains the SWF content. For more
		information related to security, see the Flash Player Developer Center
		Topic: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/devnet_security_en"
		scope="external">Security</a>.

		Switches seamlessly between files with multiple bit rates and allows a
		NetStream to resume when a connection is dropped and reconnected.
		This method is an enhanced version of `NetStream.play()`. Like the
		`play()` method, the `play2()` method begins playback of a media file
		or queues up media files to create a playlist. When used with Flash
		Media Server, it can also request that the server switch to a
		different media file. The transition occurs seamlessly in the client
		application. The following features use `play2()` stream switching:

		**Dynamic streaming**

		Dynamic streaming (supported in Flash Media Server 3.5 and later) lets
		you serve a stream encoded at multiple bit rates. As a viewer's
		network conditions change, they receive the bitrate that provides the
		best viewing experience. Use the `NetStreamInfo` class to monitor
		network conditions and switch streams based on the data. You can also
		switch streams for clients with different capabilities. For more
		information, see <a
		href="http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fms_dynstream_en"
		scope="external">"Dynamic streaming"</a> in the "Adobe Flash Media
		Server Developer Guide".

		Adobe built a custom ActionScript class called DynamicStream that
		extends the NetStream class. You can use the DynamicStream class to
		implement dynamic streaming in an application instead of writing your
		own code to detect network conditions. Even if you choose to write
		your own dynamic streaming code, use the DynamicStream class as a
		reference implementation. Download the class and the class
		documentation at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/fms_tools"
		scope="external">Flash Media Server tools and downloads</a> page.

		**Stream reconnecting**

		Stream reconnecting (supported in Flash Media Server 3.5.3 and later)
		lets users to experience media uninterrupted even when they lose their
		connection. The media uses the buffer to play while your ActionScript
		logic reconnects to Flash Media Server. After reconnection, call
		`NetStream.attach()` to use the same NetStream object with the new
		NetConnection. Use the `NetStream.attach()`,
		`NetStreamPlayTransitions.RESUME`, and
		`NetStreamPlayTrasitions.APPEND_AND_WAIT` APIs to reconnect a stream.

		Sends streaming audio, video, and data messages from a client to Flash
		Media Server, optionally recording the stream during transmission.
		This method dispatches a NetStatusEvent object with information about
		the stream. Before you call `NetStream.publish()`, capture the
		`"NetConnection.Connect.Success"` event to verify that the application
		has successfully connected to Flash Media Server.
		While publishing, you can record files in FLV or F4V format. If you
		record a file in F4V format, use a flattener tool to edit or play the
		file in another application. To download the tool, see <a
		href="http://www.adobe.com/go/fms_tools"
		scope="external">www.adobe.com/go/fms_tools</a>.

		**Note:**Do not use this method to play a stream. To play a stream,
		call the `NetStream.play()` method.

		Workflow for publishing a stream

		1. Create a NetConnection object and call `NetConnection.connect()`.
		2. Call `NetConnection.addEventListener()` to listen for NetStatusEvent
		events.
		3. On the `"NetConnection.Connect.Success"` event, create a NetStream
		object and pass the NetConnection object to the constructor.
		4. To capture audio and video, call the `NetStream.attachAudio()`method
		and the `NetStream.attachCamera()` method.
		5. To publish a stream, call the `NetStream.publish()` method. You can
		record the data as you publish it so that users can play it back
		later.

		**Note:** A NetStream can either publish a stream or play a stream, it
		cannot do both. To publish a stream and view the playback from the
		server, create two NetStream objects. You can send multiple NetStream
		objects over one NetConnection object.

		When Flash Media Server records a stream it creates a file. By
		default, the server creates a directory with the application instance
		name passed to `NetConnection.connect()` and stores the file in the
		directory. For example, the following code connects to the default
		instance of the "lectureseries" application and records a stream
		called "lecture". The file "lecture.flv" is recorded in the
		applications/lectureseries/streams/_definst_ directory:

		```as3
		var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection();
		nc.connect("rtmp://fms.example.com/lectureseries");
		nc.addEventListener(NetStatusEvent.NET_STATUS, netStatusHandler);

		function netStatusHandler(event:NetStatusEvent):void{
			if (event.info.code == "NetConnection.Connect.Success"){
				var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc);
				ns.publish("lecture", "record");
			}
		}
		```

		The following example connects to the "monday" instance of the same
		application. The file "lecture.flv" is recorded in the directory
		/applications/lectureseries/streams/monday:

		```as3
		var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection();
		nc.addEventListener(NetStatusEvent.NET_STATUS, netStatusHandler);
		nc.connect("rtmp://fms.example.com/lectureseries/monday");

		function netStatusHandler(event:NetStatusEvent):void{
			if (event.info.code == "NetConnection.Connect.Success"){
				var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc);
				ns.publish("lecture", "record");
			}
		}
		```

		@param name A string that identifies the stream. Clients that
					subscribe to this stream pass this name when they call
					`NetStream.play()`. Don't follow the stream name with a
					"/". For example, don't use the stream name `"bolero/"`.
					You can record files in the formats described in the
					following table (you cannot use `publish()` for MP3 format
					files). The syntax differs depending on the file format.

					| File format | Syntax | Example |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| FLV | Specify the stream name as a string without a filename extension. | `ns.publish("myflvstream");` |
					| MPEG-4-based files (such as F4V or MP4) | Specify the stream name as a string with the prefix `mp4:` with or without the filename extension. Flash Player doesn't encode using H.264, but Flash Media Server can record any codec in the F4V container. Flash Media Live Encoder can encode using H.264. | `ns.publish("mp4:myvideo.f4v")` `ns.publish("mp4:myvideo");` |
					| RAW | Specify the stream name as a string with the prefix `raw:` | `ns.publish("raw:myvideo");` |
		@param type A string that specifies how to publish the stream. Valid
					values are "`record`", "`append`", "`appendWithGap`", and
					"`live`". The default value is "`live`".
					* If you pass "`record`", the server publishes and records
					live data, saving the recorded data to a new file with a
					name matching the value passed to the `name` parameter. If
					the file exists, it is overwritten.
					* If you pass "`append`", the server publishes and records
					live data, appending the recorded data to a file with a
					name that matches the value passed to the `name`
					parameter. If no file matching the `name` parameter is
					found, it is created.
					* If you pass "`appendWithGap`", additional information
					about time coordination is passed to help the server
					determine the correct transition point when dynamic
					streaming.
					* If you omit this parameter or pass "`live`", the server
					publishes live data without recording it. If a file with a
					name that matches the value passed to the `name` parameter
					exists, it is deleted.

		Seeks the keyframe (also called an I-frame in the video industry)
		closest to the specified location. The keyframe is placed at an
		offset, in seconds, from the beginning of the stream.
		Video streams are usually encoded with two types of frames, keyframes
		(or I-frames) and P-frames. A keyframe contains an entire image, while
		a P-frame is an interim frame that provides additional video
		information between keyframes. A video stream typically has a keyframe
		every 10-50 frames.

		Flash Media Server has several types of seek behavior: enhanced
		seeking and smart seeking.

		**Enhanced seeking**

		Enhanced seeking is enabled by default. To disable enhanced seeking,
		on Flash Media Server set the `EnhancedSeek` element in the
		`Application.xml` configuration file to `false`.

		If enhanced seeking is enabled, the server generates a new keyframe at
		`offset` based on the previous keyframe and any intervening P-frames.
		However, generating keyframes creates a high processing load on the
		server and distortion might occur in the generated keyframe. If the
		video codec is On2, the keyframe before the seek point and any
		P-frames between the keyframe and the seek point are sent to the
		client.

		If enhanced seeking is disabled, the server starts streaming from the
		nearest keyframe. For example, suppose a video has keyframes at 0
		seconds and 10 seconds. A seek to 4 seconds causes playback to start
		at 4 seconds using the keyframe at 0 seconds. The video stays frozen
		until it reaches the next keyframe at 10 seconds. To get a better
		seeking experience, you need to reduce the keyframe interval. In
		normal seek mode, you cannot start the video at a point between the
		keyframes.

		**Smart seeking**

		To enable smart seeking, set `NetStream.inBufferSeek` to `true`.

		Smart seeking allows Flash Player to seek within an existing back
		buffer and forward buffer. When smart seeking is disabled, each time
		`seek()` is called Flash Player flushes the buffer and requests data
		from the server. For more information, see `NetStream.inBufferSeek`.

		**Seeking in Data Generation Mode**

		When you call `seek()` on a NetStream in Data Generation Mode, all
		bytes passed to `appendBytes()` are discarded (not placed in the
		buffer, accumulated in the partial message FIFO, or parsed for seek
		points) until you call
		`appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_BEGIN)` or
		`appendBytesAction(NetStreamAppendBytesAction.RESET_SEEK)` to reset
		the parser. For information about Data Generation Mode, see
		`NetStream.play()`.

		@param offset The approximate time value, in seconds, to move to in a
					  video file. With Flash Media Server, if `<EnhancedSeek>`
					  is set to `true` in the Application.xml configuration
					  file (which it is by default), the server generates a
					  keyframe at `offset`.
					  * To return to the beginning of the stream, pass 0 for
					  `offset`.

	/**
		Sends a message on a published stream to all subscribing clients. This
		method is available only to the publisher of the specified stream.
		This method is available for use with Flash Media Server only. To
		process and respond to this message, create a handler on the
		`NetStream` object, for example, `ns.HandlerName`.
		Flash Player or AIR does not serialize methods or their data, object
		prototype variables, or non-enumerable variables. For display objects,
		Flash Player or AIR serializes the path but none of the data.

		You can call the `send()` method to add data keyframes to a live
		stream published to Flash Media Server. A data keyframe is a message a
		publisher adds to a live stream. Data keyframes are typically used to
		add metadata to a live stream before data is captured for the stream
		from camera and microphone. A publisher can add a data keyframe at any
		time while the live stream is being published. The data keyframe is
		saved in the server's memory as long as the publisher is connected to
		the server.

		Clients who are subscribed to the live stream before a data keyframe
		is added receive the keyframe as soon as it is added. Clients who
		subscribe to the live stream after the data keyframe is added receive
		the keyframe when they subscribe.

		To add a keyframe of metadata to a live stream sent to Flash Media
		Server, use `@setDataFrame` as the handler name, followed by two
		additional arguments, for example:

		```as3
		var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc);
		ns.send("@setDataFrame", "onMetaData", metaData);
		```

		The `@setDataFrame` argument refers to a special handler built in to
		Flash Media Server. The `onMetaData` argument is the name of a
		callback function in your client application that listens for the
		`onMetaData` event and retrieves the metadata. The third item,
		`metaData`, is an instance of `Object` or `Array` with properties that
		define the metadata values.

		Use `@clearDataFrame` to clear a keyframe of metadata that has already
		been set in the stream:

		```as3
		ns.send("@clearDataFrame", "onMetaData");
		```

		@param handlerName The message to send; also the name of the
						   ActionScript handler to receive the message. The
						   handler name can be only one level deep (that is,
						   it can't be of the form parent/child) and is
						   relative to the stream object. Do not use a
						   reserved term for a handler name. For example,
						   using "`close`" as a handler name causes the method
						   to fail. With Flash Media Server, use
						   `@setDataFrame` to add a keyframe of metadata to a
						   live stream or `@clearDataFrame` to remove a
						   keyframe.

		Steps forward or back the specified number of frames, relative to the
		currently displayed frame. Specify a positive number to step forward
		and a negative number to step in reverse. Call this method to create
		accurate fast forward or rewind functionality.
		This method is available only when data is streaming from Flash Media
		Server 3.5.3 or higher and when `NetStream.inBufferSeek` is `true`.
		Also, the target frame must be in the buffer. For example, if the
		currently displayed frame is frame number 120 and you specify a value
		of 1000, the method fails if frame number 1120 is not in the buffer.

		This method is intended to be used with the `pause()` or
		`togglePause()` methods. If you step 10 frames forward or backward
		during playback without pausing, you may not notice the steps or
		they'll look like a glitch. Also, when you call `pause()` or
		`togglePause` the audio is suppressed.

		If the call to `NetStream.step()` is successful, a NetStatusEvent is
		sent with "NetStream.Step.Notify" as the value of the info object's
		`code` property.
