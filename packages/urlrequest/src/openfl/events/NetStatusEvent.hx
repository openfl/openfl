	/**
		An object with properties that describe the object's status or error
		condition.
		The information object could have a `code` property containing a
		string that represents a specific event or a `level` property
		containing a string that is either `"status"` or `"error"`.

		The information object could also be something different. The `code`
		and `level` properties might not work for some implementations and
		some servers might send different objects.

		P2P connections send messages to a `NetConnection` with a `stream`
		parameter in the information object that indicates which `NetStream`
		the message pertains to.

		For example, Flex Data Services sends Message objects that cause
		coercion errors if you try to access the `code` or `level` property.

		The following table describes the possible string values of the `code`
		and `level` properties.

		| Code property | Level property | Meaning |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| `"NetConnection.Call.BadVersion"` | `"error"` | Packet encoded in an unidentified format. |
		| `"NetConnection.Call.Failed"` | `"error"` | The `NetConnection.call()` method was not able to invoke the server-side method or command. |
		| `"NetConnection.Call.Prohibited"` | `"error"` | An Action Message Format (AMF) operation is prevented for security reasons. Either the AMF URL is not in the same domain as the file containing the code calling the `NetConnection.call()` method, or the AMF server does not have a policy file that trusts the domain of the the file containing the code calling the `NetConnection.call()` method. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.AppShutdown"` | `"error"` | The server-side application is shutting down. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.Closed"` | `"status"` | The connection was closed successfully. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.Failed"` | `"error"` | The connection attempt failed. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.IdleTimeout"` | `"status"` | Flash Media Server disconnected the client because the client was idle longer than the configured value for `<MaxIdleTime>`. On Flash Media Server, `<AutoCloseIdleClients>` is disabled by default. When enabled, the default timeout value is 3600 seconds (1 hour). For more information, see [Close idle connections](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flashmediaserver/configadmin/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d119f2925e64-7ff0.html#WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d119f2925e64-7fe9). |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.InvalidApp"` | `"error"` | The application name specified in the call to `NetConnection.connect()` is invalid. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.NetworkChange"` | `"status"` |  Flash Player has detected a network change, for example, a dropped wireless connection, a successful wireless connection,or a network cable loss.<br>Use this event to check for a network interface change. Don't use this event to implement your NetConnection reconnect logic. Use `"NetConnection.Connect.Closed"` to implement your NetConnection reconnect logic. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.Rejected"` | `"error"` | The connection attempt did not have permission to access the application. |
		| `"NetConnection.Connect.Success"` | `"status"` | The connection attempt succeeded. |
		| `"NetGroup.Connect.Failed"` | `"error"` | The NetGroup connection attempt failed. The `info.group` property indicates which NetGroup failed. |
		| `"NetGroup.Connect.Rejected"` | `"error"` | The NetGroup is not authorized to function. The `info.group` property indicates which NetGroup was denied. |
		| `"NetGroup.Connect.Succcess"` | `"status"` | The NetGroup is successfully constructed and authorized to function. The `info.group` property indicates which NetGroup has succeeded. |
		| `"NetGroup.LocalCoverage.Notify"` | `"status"` | Sent when a portion of the group address space for which this node is responsible changes. |
		| `"NetGroup.MulticastStream.PublishNotify"` | `"status"` | Sent when a new named stream is detected in NetGroup's Group. The `info.name:String` property is the name of the detected stream. |
		| `"NetGroup.MulticastStream.UnpublishNotify"` | `"status"` | Sent when a named stream is no longer available in the Group. The `info.name:String` property is name of the stream which has disappeared. |
		| `"NetGroup.Neighbor.Connect"` | `"status"` | Sent when a neighbor connects to this node. The `info.neighbor:String` property is the group address of the neighbor. The `info.peerID:String` property is the peer ID of the neighbor. |
		| `"NetGroup.Neighbor.Disconnect"` | `"status"` | Sent when a neighbor disconnects from this node. The `info.neighbor:String` property is the group address of the neighbor. The `info.peerID:String` property is the peer ID of the neighbor. |
		| `"NetGroup.Posting.Notify"` | `"status"` | Sent when a new Group Posting is received. The `info.message:Object` property is the message. The `info.messageID:String` property is this message's messageID. |
		| `"NetGroup.Replication.Fetch.Failed"` | `"status"` | Sent when a fetch request for an object (previously announced with NetGroup.Replication.Fetch.SendNotify) fails or is denied. A new attempt for the object will be made if it is still wanted. The `info.index:Number` property is the index of the object that had been requested. |
		| `"NetGroup.Replication.Fetch.Result"` | `"status"` | Sent when a fetch request was satisfied by a neighbor. The `info.index:Number` property is the object index of this result. The `info.object:Object` property is the value of this object. This index will automatically be removed from the Want set. If the object is invalid, this index can be re-added to the Want set with `NetGroup.addWantObjects()`. |
		| `"NetGroup.Replication.Fetch.SendNotify"` | `"status"` | Sent when the Object Replication system is about to send a request for an object to a neighbor.The `info.index:Number` property is the index of the object that is being requested. |
		| `"NetGroup.Replication.Request"` | `"status"` | Sent when a neighbor has requested an object that this node has announced with `NetGroup.addHaveObjects()`. This request **must** eventually be answered with either `NetGroup.writeRequestedObject()` or `NetGroup.denyRequestedObject()`. Note that the answer may be asynchronous. The `info.index:Number` property is the index of the object that has been requested. The `info.requestID:int` property is the ID of this request, to be used by `NetGroup.writeRequestedObject()` or `NetGroup.denyRequestedObject()`. |
		| `"NetGroup.SendTo.Notify"` | `"status"` | Sent when a message directed to this node is received. The `info.message:Object` property is the message. The `info.from:String` property is the groupAddress from which the message was received. The `info.fromLocal:Boolean` property is `TRUE` if the message was sent by this node (meaning the local node is the nearest to the destination group address), and `FALSE` if the message was received from a different node. To implement recursive routing, the message must be resent with `NetGroup.sendToNearest()` if `info.fromLocal` is `FALSE`. |
		| `"NetStream.Buffer.Empty"` | `"status"` | Flash Player is not receiving data quickly enough to fill the buffer. Data flow is interrupted until the buffer refills, at which time a `NetStream.Buffer.Full` message is sent and the stream begins playing again. |

		| `"NetStream.Buffer.Full"` | `"status"` | The buffer is full and the stream begins playing. |
		| `"NetStream.Connect.Closed"` | `"status"` | The P2P connection was closed successfully. The `info.stream` property indicates which stream has closed. |
		| `"NetStream.Connect.Failed"` | `"error"` | The P2P connection attempt failed. The `info.stream` property indicates which stream has failed. |
		| `"NetStream.Connect.Rejected"` | `"error"` | The P2P connection attempt did not have permission to access the other peer. The `info.stream` property indicates which stream was rejected. |

		| `"NetStream.MulticastStream.Reset"` | `"status"` | A multicast subscription has changed focus to a different stream published with the same name in the same group. Local overrides of multicast stream parameters are lost. Reapply the local overrides or the new stream's default parameters will be used. |
		| `"NetStream.Pause.Notify"` | `"status"` | The stream is paused. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.Failed"` | `"error"` | An error has occurred in playback for a reason other than those listed elsewhere in this table, such as the subscriber not having read access. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.FileStructureInvalid"` | `"error"` | (AIR and Flash Player 9.0.115.0) The application detects an invalid file structure and will not try to play this type of file. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.InsufficientBW"` | `"warning"` | (Flash Media Server) The client does not have sufficient bandwidth to play the data at normal speed. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.NoSupportedTrackFound"` | `"error"` | (AIR and Flash Player 9.0.115.0) The application does not detect any supported tracks (video, audio or data) and will not try to play the file. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.PublishNotify"` | `"status"` | The initial publish to a stream is sent to all subscribers. |

		| `"NetStream.Play.Transition"` | `"status"` | (Flash Media Server 3.5) The server received the command to transition to another stream as a result of bitrate stream switching. This code indicates a success status event for the `NetStream.play2()` call to initiate a stream switch. If the switch does not succeed, the server sends a `NetStream.Play.Failed` event instead. When the stream switch occurs, an `onPlayStatus` event with a code of "NetStream.Play.TransitionComplete" is dispatched. For Flash Player 10 and later. |
		| `"NetStream.Play.UnpublishNotify"` | `"status"` | An unpublish from a stream is sent to all subscribers. |
		| `"NetStream.Publish.BadName"` | `"error"` | Attempt to publish a stream which is already being published by someone else. |

		| `"NetStream.Seek.InvalidTime"` | `"error"` | For video downloaded progressively, the user has tried to seek or play past the end of the video data that has downloaded thus far, or past the end of the video once the entire file has downloaded. The `info.details` property of the event object contains a time code that indicates the last valid position to which the user can seek. |
		| `"NetStream.Seek.Notify"` | `"status"` | The seek operation is complete.<br>Sent when `NetStream.seek()` is called on a stream in AS3 NetStream Data Generation Mode. The info object is extended to include `info.seekPoint` which is the same value passed to `NetStream.seek()`. |
