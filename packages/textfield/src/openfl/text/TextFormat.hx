/**
	The TextFormat class represents character formatting information. Use the
	TextFormat class to create specific text formatting for text fields. You
	can apply text formatting to both static and dynamic text fields. The
	properties of the TextFormat class apply to device and embedded fonts.
	However, for embedded fonts, bold and italic text actually require
	specific fonts. If you want to display bold or italic text with an
	embedded font, you need to embed the bold and italic variations of that
	font.

	You must use the constructor `new TextFormat()` to create a TextFormat
	object before setting its properties. When you apply a TextFormat object
	to a text field using the `TextField.defaultTextFormat` property or the
	`TextField.setTextFormat()` method, only its defined properties are
	applied. Use the `TextField.defaultTextFormat` property to apply
	formatting BEFORE you add text to the `TextField`, and the
	`setTextFormat()` method to add formatting AFTER you add text to the
	`TextField`. The TextFormat properties are `null` by default because if
	you don't provide values for the properties, Flash Player uses its own
	default formatting. The default formatting that Flash Player uses for each
	property (if property's value is `null`) is as follows:

	| | |
	| --- | --- |
	| align = "left" | |
	| blockIndent = 0 | |
	| bold = false | |
	| bullet = false | |
	| color = 0x000000 | |
	| font = "Times New Roman" (default font is Times on Mac OS X) | |
	| indent = 0 | |
	| italic = false | |
	| kerning = false | |
	| leading = 0 | |
	| leftMargin = 0 | |
	| letterSpacing = 0 | |
	| rightMargin = 0 | |
	| size = 12 | |
	| tabStops = [] (empty array) | |
	| target = "" (empty string) | |
	| underline = false | |
	| url = "" (empty string) | |

	The default formatting for each property is also described in each
	property description.
